## Migration Notes

This documentation was reorganized on 2025-10-08 to improve organization and maintainability. Previous flat structure has been split into logical categories.

**Breaking Changes:**
- All documentation links in code and README files may need updating
- File paths have changed (e.g., `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Üí `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

**Migration TODO:**
- [ ] Update main README.md links
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md references
- [ ] Update any hardcoded documentation paths in code
- [ ] Rename NEO4J_QUERIES.md to AGE_QUERIES.md (pending Apache AGE migration completion)
