# openCypher Query Examples

Practical openCypher queries for exploring and analyzing the knowledge graph. These queries work with Apache AGE (PostgreSQL graph extension) and other openCypher-compliant graph databases.

## Query Types

Queries are organized into two main categories:

**📊 Data-Driven Results** - Tabular output for analysis, statistics, and reporting
**🕸️ Graph-Driven Results** - Visual network views for exploration and relationships

# 📊 Data-Driven Results

Queries that return tabular data, counts, and statistics. Best for analysis and reporting.

## Node Counts & Lists

### Count all nodes by type

```cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN labels(n)[0] AS type, count(n) AS count
ORDER BY count DESC
```

### View sample concepts with labels

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)
RETURN c.concept_id, c.label, c.search_terms
LIMIT 10
```

### Find all documents (ontologies) ingested

```cypher
MATCH (s:Source)
RETURN DISTINCT s.document as ontology
ORDER BY ontology
```

### List all concepts from a specific ontology

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)-[:APPEARS_IN]->(s:Source {document: "WattsTest"})
RETURN DISTINCT c.label, c.search_terms
ORDER BY c.label
```

### All relationship types in the graph

```cypher

RETURN DISTINCT type(r) as relationship_type, count(*) as count
ORDER BY count DESC
```

---

## Evidence Analysis

### Trace concept back to source quotes (tabular)

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept {label: "Human Variety"})
      -[:EVIDENCED_BY]->(i:Instance)
      -[:FROM_SOURCE]->(s:Source)
RETURN c.label,
       i.quote,
       s.document,
       s.paragraph
LIMIT 5
```

### Concepts with most evidence

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)-[:EVIDENCED_BY]->(i:Instance)
WITH c, count(i) as evidence_count
RETURN c.label, evidence_count
ORDER BY evidence_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

LIMIT 10
```

---

## Cross-Document Analysis

### Concepts appearing in multiple documents

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)-[:APPEARS_IN]->(s:Source)
WITH c, collect(DISTINCT s.document) as documents
WHERE size(documents) > 1
RETURN c.label, documents, size(documents) as doc_count
ORDER BY doc_count DESC
```

### Compare concept coverage across two documents

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)-[:APPEARS_IN]->(s:Source)
WHERE s.document IN ["Variety as a fulcrum", "Alan Watts Lecture"]
WITH c.label as concept,
     collect(DISTINCT s.document) as docs
RETURN concept,
       size(docs) as appears_in,
       CASE WHEN size(docs) = 2 THEN "both" ELSE docs[0] END as where
ORDER BY appears_in DESC, concept
```

### Unique concepts per document

```cypher
MATCH (c:Concept)-[:APPEARS_IN]->(s:Source)
WITH c, collect(DISTINCT s.document) as documents
WHERE size(documents) = 1

     [c IN concepts1 WHERE c IN concepts2] as overlap
RETURN doc1, doc2, size(overlap) as shared_concepts
ORDER BY shared_concepts DESC
```

## Query Tips

### Choosing Between Data vs Graph Views

**Use Data-Driven queries when:**
- You need counts, statistics, or metrics
- Exporting data to spreadsheets or reports
- Running aggregations or analytics
- Debugging data quality issues
- Searching for specific information

**Use Graph-Driven queries when:**
- Exploring concept relationships visually
- Understanding network structure
- Finding paths between concepts
- Discovering clusters and patterns
- Presenting to stakeholders

### Performance

- Use `LIMIT` on graph queries to avoid overwhelming visualizations (50-100 nodes max)
- Data queries can handle larger limits for reporting
- Create parameters: `:param ontology => "WattsTest"`
- Use `PROFILE` to analyze performance: `PROFILE MATCH ...`

### Graph Visualization Tips

For Apache AGE graph visualization:
1. Use the **kg CLI** for querying and results display
2. Export results to **GraphML** or **JSON** for visualization in tools like Gephi or Cytoscape
3. Use **PostgreSQL clients** (pgAdmin, DBeaver) for tabular query results
4. Graph visualization support is limited compared to Neo4j Browser - consider exporting for complex visualizations

### Formatting Results

```cypher
// Pretty-print for data analysis
MATCH (c:Concept)
RETURN c.label as Concept,
       size(c.search_terms) as SearchTermCount,
       toString(c.concept_id) as ID
LIMIT 5
```

### Using Parameters

```cypher
:param ontology => "WattsTest"
:param concept_label => "Human Variety"

// Then use in queries
MATCH (c:Concept {label: $concept_label})
RETURN c
```

---

## Schema Reference

**Nodes:**
- `Concept`: concept_id, label, embedding (1536-dim vector), search_terms (array)
- `Instance`: instance_id, quote
- `Source`: source_id, document, paragraph, full_text

**Relationships:**
- `(Concept)-[:EVIDENCED_BY]->(Instance)`
- `(Instance)-[:FROM_SOURCE]->(Source)`
- `(Concept)-[:APPEARS_IN]->(Source)`
- `(Concept)-[:IMPLIES|SUPPORTS|CONTRADICTS {confidence: float}]->(Concept)`

**Indexes:**
- Vector index: `concept-embeddings` on Concept.embedding
- Full-text: `instance_fulltext` on Instance.quote
- Full-text: `concept_fulltext` on Concept(label, search_terms)

---

## Running Queries

### kg CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the kg CLI for most queries
kg search query "your search term"
kg database stats
```

### PostgreSQL psql (Direct Database Access)
```bash
# Access PostgreSQL container directly
docker exec -it knowledge-graph-postgres psql -U postgres -d knowledge_graph

# Then run AGE queries wrapped in SELECT
SELECT * FROM cypher('knowledge_graph', $$
  MATCH (c:Concept) RETURN c.label
$$) as (label agtype);
```

### Via API (TypeScript Client)
```bash
# API server provides REST endpoints for graph operations
curl http://localhost:8000/queries/stats
```

### Query Format Notes
- Apache AGE requires wrapping openCypher in `SELECT * FROM cypher('graph_name', $$ ... $$)`
- Results are returned as `agtype` which needs type casting for PostgreSQL operations
- Use the kg CLI or API server for simplified query execution
