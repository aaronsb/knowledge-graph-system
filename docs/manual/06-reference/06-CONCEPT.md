# Concept: Why Knowledge Graphs, Not Just RAG

## The Problem with Text Retrieval

Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems work by:
1. Breaking documents into chunks
2. Creating vector embeddings for each chunk
3. Finding chunks similar to a query
4. Stuffing those chunks into context
5. Hoping the LLM can figure it out

This works... sometimes. But it has fundamental limitations:

**Ephemeral Knowledge**
Every query rebuilds understanding from scratch. There's no persistent structure, no accumulated insight. Each search is like reading the document for the first time.

**Similarity ≠ Understanding**
Vector similarity finds "related text" but doesn't understand *how* ideas relate. Does concept A support concept B? Contradict it? Depend on it? RAG can't tell you.

**No Cross-Document Synthesis**
RAG treats documents as silos. If two papers discuss the same concept using different terminology, RAG won't connect them unless the vectors happen to align.

**Lost Provenance**
When you get an answer, where did it come from? Which specific quote? From what context? RAG gives you chunks, not citations.

**No Traversal**
You can't ask "show me what connects to this" or "explore related concepts." RAG is search-only, not exploration.

## The Knowledge Graph Approach

A knowledge graph system thinks about documents differently:

**Concepts are First-Class Entities**
Instead of "chunk 47 from document X," you have:
- Label: "Requisite Variety"
- Search terms: ["Ashby's Law", "system control", "variety matching"]
- Relationships: SUPPORTS → "AI Sandwich Systems Model"
- Evidence: 3 source quotes with exact paragraph references

**Relationships Model Understanding**
The system captures *how* ideas connect:
- Concept A **IMPLIES** Concept B
- Concept C **CONTRADICTS** Concept D
- Concept E **SUPPORTS** Concept F with 0.85 confidence

These aren't just links—they represent the document's argument structure.

**Persistent, Growing Knowledge**
Once extracted, concepts persist. New documents add to the graph. Similar concepts merge automatically. The graph becomes smarter with each document ingested.

**Evidence-Based Retrieval**
Every concept links to source quotes:
```
Concept: "Value of Uselessness"
Evidence: "The whole notion of something of life...being useful...
           is to a Taoist absurd."
Source: Watts Taoism 02, paragraph 1
```

**Graph Traversal**
You can explore:
- "What supports this concept?"
- "What does this contradict?"
- "Show me the evidence chain"
- "Find concepts 2 hops away"

## What This Enables

### For Humans

**Exploration, Not Just Search**
Start with one concept, traverse relationships, discover connections you didn't know to look for.

**Provenance & Trust**
Every claim traces back to specific quotes. You can verify, not just trust.

**Concept Maps**
Visualize how ideas connect across an entire document or corpus.

### For LLMs

**Semantic Grounding**
Instead of "here's some similar text," the LLM gets:
- "Here's the concept of Requisite Variety"
- "It SUPPORTS the AI Sandwich model"
- "Evidence: [exact quotes]"
- "It's related to these 5 other concepts"

**Relationship Awareness**
The LLM can reason about how concepts connect, not just what they say.

**Multi-Document Synthesis**
Concepts from different sources automatically link, enabling cross-reference reasoning.

## The Hybrid Architecture

This system combines three approaches:

1. **Vector Search** - Find concepts semantically similar to a query
2. **Graph Traversal** - Explore relationships between concepts
3. **Full-Text Search** - Find exact quotes or terminology

RAG only has #1. This system has all three.

## What We're Not Claiming

This is **not**:
- A replacement for reading
- Perfect extraction (LLMs make mistakes)
- A solved problem (this is experimental)
- The only way to do knowledge graphs

This **is**:
- A different paradigm: persistent concepts vs ephemeral retrieval
- A synthesis of LLM extraction + graph storage + semantic search
- An experiment in what becomes possible when you model ideas, not just text

## When to Use Each

**Use RAG when:**
- You need quick, one-off queries
- Documents are homogeneous and well-structured
- You don't need to understand relationships
- You're okay rebuilding context every time

**Use Knowledge Graphs when:**
- You're building long-term knowledge bases
- Relationships between ideas matter
- You need provenance and evidence tracking
- You want to explore, not just retrieve
- You're synthesizing across multiple documents

## The Vision

Imagine ingesting:
- Your entire codebase (concepts = architectural decisions, components, dependencies)
- Research paper collections (concepts = theories, findings, methodologies)
- Company documentation (concepts = policies, procedures, best practices)
- Historical texts (concepts = events, figures, philosophical ideas)

Then querying:
- "Show me all architectural decisions related to authentication"
- "What research findings contradict the embodied cognition hypothesis?"
- "Trace the evolution of our deployment policy across all versions"
- "How do Stoic and Taoist concepts of acceptance relate?"

Not just finding similar text. **Understanding the knowledge.**

## Implementation Reality

This system:
- Uses LLMs for extraction (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Stores concepts in Neo4j with vector embeddings
- Deduplicates via vector similarity (concepts merge across documents)
- Preserves evidence links to source quotes
- Provides multiple query interfaces (MCP, CLI, Neo4j Browser)

It's not magic. It's structured extraction + graph storage + semantic retrieval.

But the combination creates something qualitatively different from RAG.

*The goal isn't to replace RAG. It's to explore what becomes possible when we move from retrieving text to modeling knowledge.*
