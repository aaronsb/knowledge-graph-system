# Use Cases: Practical Workflows

This guide catalogs real-world workflows for the Knowledge Graph System. Each use case demonstrates specific techniques for multi-ontology ingestion, semantic analysis, and knowledge extraction.

## Available Use Cases

### 1. [GitHub Project History Analysis](use_cases/github_project_history.md)

**Mining your repository for knowledge using GitHub CLI**

Extract commit messages and pull requests with `gh` CLI, organize them into directories, and ingest as separate ontologies. The graph automatically discovers connections between commits and PRs, enabling semantic search across your entire project history.

**Key Techniques:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for data extraction
- Directory-based ontology organization
- Multi-source automatic concept linking
- Temporal analysis and contributor insights

**What You'll Learn:**
- Why features were implemented certain ways
- Who has expertise in specific areas
- How architectural decisions evolved
- Related commits/PRs (even without explicit references)
- Team development patterns

## Planned Use Cases

These use cases are planned for future documentation. Contributions welcome!

### 2. Research Paper Analysis
**Status:** Planned

Ingest related research papers as separate ontologies, discover connections between research threads, trace citations and concept evolution.

### 3. Legal Document Comparison
**Status:** Planned

Multiple versions of contracts or regulations tracked over time, comparing changes and concept evolution across revisions.

### 4. Knowledge Base Migration
**Status:** Planned

Ingest existing documentation sets from different sources, find gaps and redundancies, unify terminology.

### 5. Meeting Notes and Project Documentation
**Status:** Planned

Combine meeting transcripts with technical documentation for complete project context, linking discussions to decisions.

### 6. Multi-Language Code Documentation
**Status:** Planned

Ingest documentation from different programming language ecosystems, find patterns and translate concepts across languages.

### 7. Customer Support Knowledge Base
**Status:** Planned

Build searchable knowledge from support tickets, FAQs, and resolution notes, automatically categorizing issues.

## General Workflow Patterns

Across all use cases, these patterns emerge:

### Multi-Ontology Organization

**Pattern:** Organize related but distinct data sources as separate ontologies
- **Example:** Commits vs pull requests, or papers vs patents
- **Benefit:** Targeted querying and clearer data lineage
- **Automatic linking:** Graph connects concepts across ontologies

### Directory-Based Ingestion

**Pattern:** One document per file, organized in directories
- **Example:** `project_history/commits/*.txt` and `project_history/pull_requests/*.txt`
- **Command:** `kg ingest directory path/to/dir --ontology "name"`
- **Benefit:** Simple, file-system-based organization

### Metadata-Rich Documents

**Pattern:** Structure documents with metadata headers
```
Title: Document Title
Author: Jane Doe
Date: 2025-10-14
Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3

[Main content...]
```
- **Benefit:** LLM extracts structured metadata as concepts
- **Enables:** Author-based queries, temporal analysis, tag-based filtering

### Incremental Updates

**Pattern:** Add new documents to existing ontologies
- **Deduplication:** Graph automatically detects duplicate content via SHA-256 hashing
- **Growth:** Knowledge compounds over time
- **Benefit:** No need to re-ingest entire corpus
