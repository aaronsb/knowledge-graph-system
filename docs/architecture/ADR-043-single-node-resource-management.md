# ADR-043: Single-Node Resource Management for Local Inference

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Implemented:** 2025-10-23
**Deciders:** System Architects
**Related:** ADR-039 (Local Embedding Service), ADR-042 (Local LLM Inference)

## Context

With the introduction of local inference capabilities (ADR-042: Ollama for extraction, ADR-039: sentence-transformers for embeddings), the system can now run entirely on local GPU hardware. However, this creates resource contention on single-node deployments where both models compete for limited VRAM.

### Resource Conflict Scenario

**Typical Ingestion Pipeline:**
1. **Extraction Phase** (2-3 minutes per chunk)
   - Ollama loads GPT-OSS 20B into VRAM (~10-12GB)
   - Model stays resident due to `keep_alive` default behavior
   - GPU utilization: 100% during inference

2. **Embedding Phase** (immediate after extraction)
   - nomic-embed-text-v1.5 attempts to load into VRAM (~275MB base + overhead)
   - **Collision**: Insufficient free VRAM with extraction model still resident
   - Embedding generation silently fails or crashes

### Problem Manifestation

Users reported "silent failures" during ingestion:
- First chunk succeeds (cold start, no models loaded)
- Subsequent chunks fail at embedding phase
- No error logs (with `verbose=False`)
- Jobs appear to complete but produce zero concepts

**Real-world case:**
```
09:02:22 | INFO  | ‚úì Extracted 22 concepts, 22 instances, 15 relationships
[silence - all 22 concepts fail embedding generation]
```

### Hardware Constraints

**Single-GPU Systems:**
- Total VRAM: 12-24GB (typical workstation GPUs)
- Extraction model: 8-16GB (depending on model size)
- Embedding model: 500MB (with safety margin)
- **Gap**: Often <500MB free after extraction

**Multi-GPU Systems:**
- Could isolate models to separate GPUs
- Adds complexity of device management
- Not accessible to most users

## Decision

Implement **dynamic device selection with intelligent CPU fallback** for the embedding model:

### Strategy

**Pre-flight VRAM Check** (one-time per chunk):
1. Before embedding pass begins, check available VRAM
2. If free VRAM >= 500MB ‚Üí use GPU (`cuda:0`)
3. If free VRAM < 500MB ‚Üí use CPU with clear warning

**Warning Message:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Not enough VRAM (250MB free, 500MB required)
üîÑ Moving embedding model to CPU mode (performance degraded ~100ms/batch)
```

### Implementation Details

**Location:** `embedding_model_manager.py` ‚Üí `generate_embedding()`

```python
def generate_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
    # One-time device selection (cached per embedding session)
    if not hasattr(self, '_device'):
        self._device = self._select_device()

    embedding = self.model.encode(
        text,
        normalize_embeddings=True,
        device=self._device  # Dynamic: 'cuda:0' or 'cpu'
    )
    return embedding.tolist()

def _select_device(self) -> str:
    """Select compute device based on VRAM availability"""
    import torch

    # Check if CUDA available
    if not torch.cuda.is_available():
        return 'cpu'

    # Check free VRAM
    try:
        free_vram_bytes, total_vram_bytes = torch.cuda.mem_get_info()
        free_vram_mb = free_vram_bytes / (1024 ** 2)

        if free_vram_mb >= 500:
            logger.info(f"‚úì Sufficient VRAM ({int(free_vram_mb)}MB free), using GPU")
            return 'cuda:0'
        else:
            logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Not enough VRAM ({int(free_vram_mb)}MB free, 500MB required)")
            logger.warning("üîÑ Moving embedding model to CPU mode (performance degraded ~100ms/batch)")
            return 'cpu'
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not check VRAM: {e}, defaulting to CPU")
        return 'cpu'
```

### Performance Characteristics

**GPU Mode (VRAM available):**
- Embedding time: ~1-2ms per concept
- 22 concepts: ~22-44ms total
- Preferred when available

**CPU Fallback Mode (VRAM contention):**
- Embedding time: ~5-10ms per concept
- 22 concepts: ~110-220ms total
- **Penalty: ~100-180ms per chunk**

**Context:** In a 2-3 minute extraction job, a 100ms embedding penalty is **negligible** (<0.1% overhead).

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Reliable Operation**
   - No silent failures
   - Graceful degradation instead of crashes
   - Works on any hardware configuration

2. **Minimal Performance Impact**
   - 100ms penalty is invisible in multi-minute jobs
   - GPU used when available (zero overhead)
   - No model reloading delays

3. **Transparent Operation**
   - Clear warning messages explain resource decisions
   - Users understand why performance may vary
   - Logs show device selection reasoning

4. **Zero Configuration**
   - No user intervention required
   - Works out-of-box on any system
   - Adapts to changing resource conditions

5. **Predictable Behavior**
   - Single VRAM check per chunk (not per concept)
   - Consistent device selection within batch
   - No mid-flight switching

### Negative

1. **Sub-optimal Resource Usage**
   - Could theoretically use GPU even with <500MB by unloading Ollama
   - Leaves some performance on the table
   - Trade-off: simplicity vs maximum performance

2. **No Cross-Model Coordination**
   - Doesn't actively manage Ollama's `keep_alive`
   - Passive adaptation rather than active resource negotiation
   - Could be improved in future with model orchestration

### Neutral

1. **Hardware Dependency**
   - Behavior varies based on GPU size
   - 16GB GPU: Usually GPU mode
   - 8GB GPU: Usually CPU mode
   - Consistent for a given system

2. **Embedding Latency Variance**
   - First chunk may use GPU (cold start)
   - Subsequent chunks may use CPU (contention)
   - Users see ~100ms variation in chunk processing time

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Always Use CPU for Embeddings

**Approach:** If extraction provider is Ollama, force embeddings to CPU.

**Pros:**
- Simplest implementation
- Always reliable
- No VRAM checks needed

**Cons:**
- Wastes GPU when available (e.g., small extraction models)
- Arbitrary 100ms penalty even when unnecessary
- Doesn't adapt to resource changes

**Verdict:** Too conservative, leaves performance on table.

---

### Alternative 2: Always Use GPU for Embeddings

**Approach:** Assume sufficient VRAM, fail if not available.

**Pros:**
- Best performance when it works
- No fallback complexity

**Cons:**
- Fails on most single-GPU systems
- Silent failures (the original problem)
- Requires manual intervention

**Verdict:** Unreliable, recreates original issue.

---

### Alternative 3: Ollama `keep_alive` Management

**Approach:** Explicitly unload extraction model before embedding phase.

```python
# After extraction
POST /api/generate {"model": "gpt-oss:20b", "keep_alive": 0}
time.sleep(2)  # Wait for unload
# Then embeddings on GPU
```

**Pros:**
- Always uses GPU for embeddings
- Maximum performance
- Explicit resource coordination

**Cons:**
- Adds 2-5 second delay per chunk (unload + reload overhead)
- Next chunk must reload extraction model (30s+ for large models)
- Ollama API call overhead
- Tightly couples extraction and embedding logic

**Verdict:** Too slow, adds 30+ seconds per chunk.

---

### Alternative 4: Model Reloading (GPU ‚Üî CPU)

**Approach:** Reload embedding model to CPU when VRAM insufficient.

```python
if vram < 500:
    reload_embedding_model(device='cpu')
# Do embeddings
if originally_on_gpu:
    reload_embedding_model(device='cuda:0')
```

**Pros:**
- Adapts to resource availability
- Could reload back to GPU after extraction

**Cons:**
- Model reload overhead: 1-2 seconds per switch
- Adds complexity (model lifecycle management)
- State management issues
- Slower than just using CPU

**Verdict:** Complexity not justified by 1-2s savings.

---

### Alternative 5: Separate VRAM Pools (Multi-GPU)

**Approach:** Assign extraction to GPU 0, embeddings to GPU 1.

```python
extraction_device = 'cuda:0'
embedding_device = 'cuda:1'
```

**Pros:**
- No resource contention
- Both models run at full speed
- Scales to more models

**Cons:**
- Requires multi-GPU system (minority of users)
- Adds device management complexity
- Doesn't solve single-GPU case

**Verdict:** Good for multi-GPU, but need single-GPU solution too.

---

### Alternative 6: Unified Model Server

**Approach:** Single inference server manages all models (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM).

**Pros:**
- Sophisticated resource scheduling
- Batch processing optimization
- Production-grade solution

**Cons:**
- Massive architecture change
- Vendor lock-in
- Overkill for single-node deployment
- Still doesn't guarantee no contention

**Verdict:** Future consideration for scale, not for current scope.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Add VRAM check function to `embedding_model_manager.py`
- [ ] Implement `_select_device()` with 500MB threshold
- [ ] Add warning logs for CPU fallback
- [ ] Test on systems with varying VRAM (8GB, 16GB, 24GB)
- [ ] Update documentation with resource recommendations
- [ ] Add performance metrics to logs (device used, embedding time)

## Recommendations

### For Users

**Optimal Hardware:**
- 16GB+ VRAM: Both models fit comfortably, GPU mode
- 12GB VRAM: Tight fit, may use CPU mode with large extraction models
- 8GB VRAM: CPU mode likely for embeddings

**Model Selection:**
- Extraction: Smaller models (7-8B) leave room for GPU embeddings
- Extraction: Larger models (20B+) trigger CPU fallback

**Performance Expectations:**
- GPU mode: 2-3 minutes per chunk
- CPU mode: 2.1-3.1 minutes per chunk (~0.1% slower)

### For Developers

**Monitoring:**
- Log device selection decision
- Track embedding latency by device
- Alert on repeated CPU fallback (may indicate undersized GPU)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Configurable VRAM threshold (default 500MB)
- Multi-GPU device assignment
- Ollama `keep_alive` coordination
- Unified model server integration (vLLM, etc.)

## Notes

This ADR represents a pragmatic approach to resource management: simple, reliable, and transparent. While more sophisticated solutions exist (unified model servers, advanced scheduling), they add complexity inappropriate for single-node deployments.

The 100ms CPU fallback penalty is negligible in the context of 2-3 minute extraction times, making this a high-reliability, low-overhead solution.

Future work may explore active resource coordination, but this passive adaptation approach provides a solid foundation.
