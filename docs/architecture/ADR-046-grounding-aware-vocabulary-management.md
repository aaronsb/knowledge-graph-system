# ADR-046: Grounding-Aware Vocabulary Management

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Authors:** System Architecture Team
**Related:** ADR-032 (Automatic Edge Vocabulary Expansion), ADR-044 (Probabilistic Truth Convergence), ADR-045 (Unified Embedding Generation)

## Context

### The ADR-044/045/046 Trio

This ADR completes a three-part system for truth convergence in the knowledge graph:

| ADR | Focus | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **ADR-044** | **Theory** | Probabilistic truth convergence through grounding strength |
| **ADR-045** | **Storage** | Unified embedding generation infrastructure |
| **ADR-046** | **Management** | Vocabulary lifecycle with grounding awareness |

### The Vocabulary Dilution Problem

As the system operates, vocabulary expands through LLM-generated edge types (ADR-032). While this enables semantic richness, unchecked growth creates **dilution risks**:

**Problem 1: LLM Prompt Cognitive Overload**

```python
# Manageable (30 types)
EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Relationships: IMPLIES, SUPPORTS, CONTRADICTS, ENABLES, ... (30 types)
"""

# Cognitive overload (200 types)
EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Relationships: IMPLIES, SUPPORTS, CONTRADICTS, ENABLES, ENHANCES, FACILITATES,
STRENGTHENS, REINFORCES, BOLSTERS, UPHOLDS, VALIDATES, CORROBORATES,
SUBSTANTIATES, CONFIRMS, VERIFIES, ATTESTS, ... (200 types)
"""
```

**Result:** LLM gets confused, picks random types, extraction quality degrades.

**Problem 2: Synonym Explosion**

```sql
-- Production data (2025-10-25):
SUPPORTS (38 edges) [B]           -- Builtin
SUPPORTED_BY (1 edge)             -- LLM-created inverse
ENHANCES (1 edge)                 -- LLM-created near-synonym
STRENGTHENS (0 edges)             -- Future LLM invention (likely)
REINFORCES (0 edges)              -- Future LLM invention (likely)
CORROBORATES (0 edges)            -- Future LLM invention (likely)
```

All semantically similar, but treated as distinct types. This dilutes:
- **Grounding calculations** - Support split across 6 types instead of 1
- **Similarity matching** - Concept matching confused by near-duplicates
- **Operator comprehension** - Which type should humans use?
- **Query results** - Relationships scattered across synonyms

**Problem 3: Grounding Strength Degradation**

```python
# Before synonym explosion
Concept "System uses Apache AGE":
  ← SUPPORTS (38 edges, avg confidence 0.85) = 32.3 weight
  grounding_strength = 32.3 / 32.3 = 1.00 (100%)

# After synonym explosion
Concept "System uses Apache AGE":
  ← SUPPORTS (12 edges, avg confidence 0.85) = 10.2 weight
  ← CORROBORATES (8 edges, avg confidence 0.80) = 6.4 weight
  ← VALIDATES (7 edges, avg confidence 0.82) = 5.74 weight
  ← CONFIRMS (6 edges, avg confidence 0.83) = 4.98 weight
  ← STRENGTHENS (5 edges, avg confidence 0.81) = 4.05 weight

  # Grounding calculation WITHOUT synonym awareness
  grounding_strength = 10.2 / 31.37 = 0.325 (32%)  ← INCORRECT!

  # Should be: All are "support-like", total = 31.37
  grounding_strength = 31.37 / 31.37 = 1.00 (100%)
```

**The core issue:** Binary pruning (keep/delete) doesn't preserve semantic meaning. We need **grounding-aware clustering** that understands synonyms contribute to the same semantic dimension.

### Current State: ADR-032 Sliding Window

**Existing system** (implemented):

```python
VOCAB_MIN = 30          # Protected builtins
VOCAB_MAX = 90          # Soft limit - start pruning
VOCAB_EMERGENCY = 200   # Hard limit - aggressive pruning

def calculate_aggressiveness(vocab_size: int) -> float:
    """
    Returns pruning aggressiveness (0.0-1.0).

    Zones:
    - Safe (30-90): 0.0 (no pruning)
    - Active (90-150): 0.0-0.5 (gentle)
    - Critical (150-200): 0.5-1.0 (aggressive)
    - Emergency (200+): 1.0 (maximum)
    """
```

**Pruning strategies:**
- **Naive:** Usage count only (low edges = prune)
- **HITL:** Human-in-the-loop approval
- **AITL:** AI-in-the-loop suggestions

**Gaps in ADR-032:**
1. ❌ No embedding-based synonym detection (uses string matching only)
2. ❌ No grounding contribution awareness
3. ❌ No protection for high-value types in truth convergence
4. ❌ No dynamic prompt curation (shows all types to LLM)

### How ADR-044/045 Enable Better Management

**ADR-044 provides:**
- Grounding strength calculation for all concepts
- Ability to measure edge type contribution to grounding
- Truth convergence metrics

**ADR-045 provides:**
- Embeddings for all vocabulary types (builtins + LLM-generated)
- Semantic similarity measurement (not just string matching)
- Consistent embedding model across vocabulary

**ADR-046 leverages both:**
- Embedding similarity → accurate synonym detection
- Grounding contribution → value-based pruning priorities
- Semantic clustering → preserve meaning while consolidating

## Decision

### Implement Grounding-Aware Vocabulary Management

Extend ADR-032 with **grounding contribution metrics** and **embedding-based synonym clustering** to:
1. Prevent dilution of grounding strength through synonym consolidation
2. Protect high-value types that contribute significantly to truth convergence
3. Dynamically curate vocabulary subsets for LLM prompts
4. Manage vocabulary lifecycle with semantic awareness

### Core Principles

**Principle 1: Semantic Clustering**
```
Vocabulary is not a flat list - it's clusters in embedding space.

Cluster 1 (Support dimension):
  SUPPORTS [canonical] ← 38 edges, builtin
  ├─ CORROBORATES ← 8 edges, similarity 0.91
  ├─ VALIDATES ← 7 edges, similarity 0.88
  ├─ CONFIRMS ← 6 edges, similarity 0.87
  └─ STRENGTHENS ← 5 edges, similarity 0.85

All contribute to the SAME semantic dimension in grounding.
```

**Principle 2: Grounding Contribution is Value**
```python
# Type A: High usage, low grounding impact
RELATED_TO: 45 edges, but grounding_contribution = 0.05
# → Low value (structural, doesn't affect truth)

# Type B: Low usage, high grounding impact
SUPPORTS: 38 edges, grounding_contribution = 0.92
# → High value (evidential, critical for truth)

# Type C: Low usage, low grounding impact
TAGGED_WITH: 2 edges, grounding_contribution = 0.01
# → Candidate for pruning
```

**Principle 3: Dynamic LLM Vocabulary**
```python
# Don't show all 200 types to LLM
# Show curated subset based on:
# 1. Document domain relevance
# 2. Global usage frequency
# 3. Grounding contribution
# 4. Semantic diversity (avoid near-duplicates)

get_extraction_vocabulary(document, max_types=50)
# → [SUPPORTS, ENABLES, REQUIRES, ...] (50 diverse, high-value types)
```

### Enhanced Vocabulary Scoring

**Extend `EdgeTypeScore` with grounding metrics:**

```python
@dataclass
class EdgeTypeScore:
    """
    Extended scoring for vocabulary types with grounding awareness.

    ADR-032 metrics (existing):
    - usage_count: How many edges use this type
    - bridge_score: Connects disconnected subgraphs
    - trend_score: Usage trending up/down

    ADR-046 metrics (new):
    - grounding_contribution: Impact on grounding strength
    - synonym_cluster_size: Number of near-synonyms (redundancy indicator)
    - avg_confidence: Average edge confidence
    - semantic_diversity: Distance from nearest neighbor in embedding space
    """
    # Existing (ADR-032)
    relationship_type: str
    usage_count: int
    bridge_score: float        # 0.0-1.0
    trend_score: float         # -1.0 to +1.0

    # New (ADR-046)
    grounding_contribution: float     # 0.0-1.0
    synonym_cluster_size: int         # Number of types with similarity > 0.85
    avg_confidence: float             # Average confidence of edges
    semantic_diversity: float         # 0.0-1.0 (distance to nearest neighbor)

    # Computed
    value_score: float         # Composite score (see calculation below)

    def calculate_value_score(self) -> float:
        """
        Composite value score for pruning decisions.

        High value = protect from pruning
        Low value = candidate for consolidation/pruning
        """
        score = 0.0

        # Usage weight (20%)
        score += (self.usage_count / 100) * 0.20

        # Grounding contribution weight (40%)
        # This is the MOST important metric for truth convergence
        score += self.grounding_contribution * 0.40

        # Bridge score weight (15%)
        score += self.bridge_score * 0.15

        # Semantic diversity weight (15%)
        # High diversity = unique semantic niche (protect)
        # Low diversity = redundant with others (merge candidate)
        score += self.semantic_diversity * 0.15

        # Trend weight (10%)
        # Positive trend = gaining usage (protect)
        # Negative trend = declining (merge candidate)
        score += (self.trend_score + 1.0) / 2.0 * 0.10

        # Penalty for large synonym clusters (redundancy)
        if self.synonym_cluster_size > 1:
            redundancy_penalty = min(0.3, self.synonym_cluster_size * 0.05)
            score -= redundancy_penalty

        return max(0.0, min(1.0, score))  # Clamp to [0.0, 1.0]
```

**Example scoring:**

```python
# High-value type: SUPPORTS
EdgeTypeScore(
    type="SUPPORTS",
    usage_count=38,
    bridge_score=0.67,
    trend_score=0.15,
    grounding_contribution=0.92,      # Critical for truth convergence!
    synonym_cluster_size=1,           # Unique (no near-synonyms yet)
    avg_confidence=0.85,
    semantic_diversity=0.88,          # Far from other types
    value_score=0.89                  # HIGH VALUE - PROTECT
)

# Low-value type: CORROBORATES
EdgeTypeScore(
    type="CORROBORATES",
    usage_count=1,
    bridge_score=0.02,
    trend_score=-0.20,
    grounding_contribution=0.02,      # Minimal impact (only 1 edge)
    synonym_cluster_size=4,           # Redundant with SUPPORTS cluster
    avg_confidence=0.78,
    semantic_diversity=0.12,          # Very close to SUPPORTS (0.91 similarity)
    value_score=0.18                  # LOW VALUE - MERGE CANDIDATE
)
```

### Grounding Contribution Calculation

```python
def calculate_grounding_contribution(edge_type: str, age_client) -> float:
    """
    Measure how much this edge type contributes to grounding across all concepts.

    High contribution = valuable for truth convergence
    Low contribution = candidate for pruning

    Algorithm:
    1. Find all concepts with edges of this type
    2. For each concept, calculate grounding WITH and WITHOUT this type
    3. Sum the absolute deltas
    4. Normalize by number of concepts

    Returns:
        Float 0.0-1.0 indicating grounding contribution
    """
    # Find concepts with this edge type
    query = f"""
    MATCH (c:Concept)<-[r:{edge_type}]-()
    RETURN DISTINCT c.concept_id as concept_id
    """
    concepts = age_client._execute_cypher(query)

    if not concepts:
        return 0.0  # No edges = no contribution

    total_delta = 0.0

    for concept in concepts:
        concept_id = concept["concept_id"]

        # Calculate grounding WITH this edge type
        grounding_with = calculate_grounding_strength_semantic(
            concept_id,
            include_types=[edge_type]
        )["grounding_strength"]

        # Calculate grounding WITHOUT this edge type
        grounding_without = calculate_grounding_strength_semantic(
            concept_id,
            exclude_types=[edge_type]
        )["grounding_strength"]

        # How much does this edge type affect grounding?
        delta = abs(grounding_with - grounding_without)
        total_delta += delta

    # Average delta across all concepts
    avg_contribution = total_delta / len(concepts)

    # Normalize to [0.0, 1.0]
    # Delta of 0.5 or more = maximum contribution
    return min(1.0, avg_contribution * 2.0)
```

**Example:**

```python
# SUPPORTS: High contribution
calculate_grounding_contribution("SUPPORTS")
# 38 concepts affected
# Average delta: 0.47 (removing SUPPORTS drops grounding by 47% on average)
# → 0.94 contribution (critical!)

# RELATED_TO: Low contribution
calculate_grounding_contribution("RELATED_TO")
# 23 concepts affected
# Average delta: 0.02 (removing RELATED_TO barely affects grounding)
# → 0.04 contribution (not important for truth)
```

### Embedding-Based Synonym Detection

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Enhanced Scoring (Week 1)

**1. Extend `EdgeTypeScore` dataclass**

File: `src/api/lib/vocabulary_scoring.py`

Add new fields:
- `grounding_contribution: float`
- `synonym_cluster_size: int`
- `avg_confidence: float`
- `semantic_diversity: float`

**2. Implement grounding contribution calculation**

File: `src/api/lib/vocabulary_scoring.py`

```python
def calculate_grounding_contribution(
    edge_type: str,
    age_client
) -> float:
    """Calculate grounding contribution for edge type."""
    # Implementation from Decision section above
```

**3. Update `VocabularyScorer.score_edge_types()`**

Calculate all new metrics for each edge type.

### Phase 2: Embedding-Based Synonym Detection (Week 2)

**1. Implement synonym clustering**

File: `src/api/lib/synonym_detector.py`

Update to use embeddings instead of string similarity:

```python
def detect_synonyms_semantic(
    age_client,
    similarity_threshold: float = 0.85
) -> List[SynonymCandidate]:
    """
    Detect synonyms using embedding similarity (ADR-045).

    Replaces string-based detection with semantic similarity.
    """
    # Implementation from Decision section above
```

**2. Implement canonical type selection**

```python
def select_canonical_type(
    cluster: Set[str],
    age_client
) -> str:
    """Select canonical type from synonym cluster."""
    # Implementation from Decision section above
```

### Phase 3: Dynamic Vocabulary Curation (Week 3)

**1. Implement vocabulary subset selection**

File: `src/api/lib/vocabulary_curator.py` (new)

```python
def get_extraction_vocabulary(
    document_context: Optional[str] = None,
    max_types: int = 50,
    min_grounding: float = 0.3,
    age_client = None
) -> List[str]:
    """Curate vocabulary subset for LLM extraction."""
    # Implementation from Decision section above
```

**2. Update extraction prompt to use curated vocabulary**

File: `src/api/lib/llm_extractor.py`

```python
# Current (shows all types)
formatted_prompt = EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(
    relationship_types=RELATIONSHIP_TYPES_LIST
)

# Updated (shows curated subset)
curated_types = get_extraction_vocabulary(
    document_context=text[:1000],  # First 1000 chars for context
    max_types=50,
    age_client=age_client
)
formatted_prompt = EXTRACTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(
    relationship_types=", ".join(curated_types)
)
```

### Phase 4: Grounding-Aware Merge Recommendations (Week 4)

**1. Update merge recommendation algorithm**

File: `src/api/lib/pruning_strategies.py`

```python
def generate_recommendations_grounding_aware(
    vocab_size: int,
    age_client
) -> List[ActionRecommendation]:
    """Generate merge recommendations with grounding awareness."""
    # Implementation from Decision section above
```

**2. Update merge execution to preserve embeddings**

File: `src/api/lib/age_client.py`

Update `merge_edge_types()` to handle embeddings (per ADR-045):

```python
def merge_edge_types(
    self,
    deprecated_type: str,
    target_type: str,
    performed_by: str = "system"
) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Merge edge types with embedding management."""
    # Existing graph edge update logic...

    # NEW: Ensure target has embedding
    if not self.get_vocabulary_embedding(target_type):
        worker = EmbeddingWorker(get_provider(), self)
        worker.generate_vocabulary_embedding(target_type)

    # Preserve deprecated embedding for rollback
    # (mark as inactive, don't delete)

    # ... rest of existing logic
```

### Phase 5: Admin Endpoints (Week 5)

**1. Vocabulary analysis endpoint**

File: `src/api/routes/vocabulary.py`

```python
@router.get("/vocab/analysis")
async def analyze_vocabulary():
    """
    Analyze vocabulary with grounding metrics.

    Returns:
        - Synonym clusters
        - Grounding contribution scores
        - Merge recommendations
        - Vocabulary health metrics
    """
    age_client = get_age_client()

    # Find synonym clusters
    clusters = find_synonym_clusters(age_client)

    # Score all types
    scorer = VocabularyScorer(age_client)
    scores = scorer.score_all_types()

    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = generate_merge_recommendations(
        vocab_size=len(scores),
        age_client=age_client
    )

    return {
        "vocab_size": len(scores),
        "synonym_clusters": clusters,
        "top_contributors": [s for s in scores if s.grounding_contribution > 0.5],
        "merge_recommendations": recommendations
    }
```

**2. CLI command**

File: `client/src/cli/vocab.ts`

```bash
kg vocab analyze
# Shows:
# - Current vocabulary size
# - Synonym clusters
# - Grounding contribution scores
# - Merge recommendations
```

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Prevents grounding dilution** - Synonym clustering preserves semantic meaning
✅ **Protects high-value types** - Truth-critical types protected from pruning
✅ **Scales with vocabulary growth** - Embedding-based approach handles any size
✅ **Reduces LLM confusion** - Dynamic curation shows relevant subset only
✅ **Automatic synonym detection** - No manual classification needed
✅ **Grounding-aware decisions** - Pruning/merging considers truth impact
✅ **Future-proof** - Works with any embedding model (ADR-045)

### Negative

⚠️ **Computational overhead** - Grounding contribution calculation is expensive
⚠️ **Merge complexity** - Need to handle embeddings, graph edges, and history
⚠️ **Requires ADR-044/045** - Cannot implement independently
⚠️ **Operator learning curve** - New metrics to understand (grounding contribution)

### Trade-offs

**Computation vs Accuracy**
- **More computation:** Grounding contribution requires re-calculating grounding for many concepts
- **Better accuracy:** Merging based on semantic meaning + truth impact
- **Mitigation:** Cache grounding contribution scores, recalculate periodically

**Automation vs Control**
- **More automation:** Embedding-based synonym detection finds clusters automatically
- **Less operator control:** May merge types operator wants separate
- **Mitigation:** HITL review level for high-grounding types

**Vocabulary Size vs Extraction Quality**
- **Smaller vocabulary:** Better LLM extraction (less confusion)
- **Less semantic granularity:** Nuanced relationships lost
- **Mitigation:** Dynamic curation preserves diversity while limiting size

## Related Decisions

**Dependency chain:**
```
ADR-045 (Embeddings)
    ↓
ADR-044 (Grounding)
    ↓
ADR-046 (Management) ← This ADR
```

**Extends:**
- **ADR-032:** Automatic Edge Vocabulary Expansion (adds grounding awareness)

**Enables:**
- **ADR-044:** Probabilistic Truth Convergence (protects grounding from dilution)

**Requires:**
- **ADR-045:** Unified Embedding Generation (for semantic similarity)

## Validation & Testing

### Test Scenarios

**1. Synonym Detection**
- Create types: SUPPORTS, CORROBORATES, VALIDATES
- Run synonym detection
- Verify: All clustered together (similarity >0.85)
- Verify: SUPPORTS selected as canonical (builtin, highest grounding)

**2. Grounding Contribution**
- Create concept with 10 SUPPORTS edges
- Calculate grounding contribution for SUPPORTS
- Remove SUPPORTS edges, recalculate
- Verify: Contribution score reflects grounding delta

**3. Dynamic Vocabulary Curation**
- Vocabulary size: 150 types
- Request curated subset (max 50)
- Verify: High-grounding types included
- Verify: Near-synonyms excluded (semantic diversity)

**4. Merge Recommendation Priorities**
- Vocab size: 120 (active zone, aggressiveness=0.4)
- Generate recommendations
- Verify: Inverse pairs (SUPPORTED_BY → SUPPORTS) have high priority
- Verify: High-grounding types require HITL review

**5. Grounding Preservation After Merge**
- Concept has 5 CORROBORATES edges (grounding=0.80)
- Merge CORROBORATES → SUPPORTS
- Recalculate grounding
- Verify: Grounding preserved (still ~0.80)

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Grounding contribution accurately reflects truth impact
- [ ] Synonym clustering finds semantically similar types
- [ ] Canonical selection prefers builtins and high-grounding types
- [ ] Dynamic curation limits LLM prompt to 40-50 diverse types
- [ ] Merge recommendations prioritize low-impact, high-similarity types
- [ ] Grounding strength preserved after synonym consolidation

## Implementation Status

**Prerequisites:**
- [ ] ADR-045 Phase 1: EmbeddingWorker (must complete first)

2. Extend `EdgeTypeScore` with grounding metrics
3. Implement grounding contribution calculation
4. Update synonym detection to use embeddings
5. Test with production vocabulary (64 types)
