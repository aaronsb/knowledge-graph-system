# ADR-015: Backup/Restore Streaming Architecture

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Deciders:** System Architecture
**Related:** ADR-012 (API Server), ADR-013 (Unified Client)

## Context

The current backup/restore implementation has architectural issues that violate client-server separation:

**Current Problems:**
1. **Server-side storage:** Backups created in `./backups` on API server
2. **Filename-based restore:** Client sends filename, expects server-side file
3. **No client-side backups:** Users don't have local copies
4. **Poor separation:** Client can't manage its own backups
5. **No progress feedback:** Large backups have no upload/download indication
6. **Memory concerns:** Loading entire backups into memory for processing

**POC Legacy:**
The original POC had excellent backup/restore UX with progress bars and detailed feedback during restore operations. We need to preserve this quality while implementing proper architecture.

## Decision

Implement **client-side backup storage with streaming upload/download**:

### Architecture Pattern

```
Backup Flow (Download):
Client                          API Server
  |                                |
  |------ POST /admin/backup ----->|
  |       (type, ontology)          |
  |                                 |--- Create backup in memory/temp
  |                                 |--- Stream JSON data (chunked)
  |<----- Stream backup data -------|
  |       + progress updates        |
  |                                 |--- Delete temp file
  |--- Save to local directory      |
  |    (~/.local/share/kg/backups)  |
  |--- Show download progress       |

Restore Flow (Upload):
Client                          API Server
  |                                |
  |--- Read backup from local       |
  |                                |
  |------ POST /admin/restore ----->|
  |       (multipart upload)        |
  |       Stream file chunks        |
  |                                 |--- Save to temp (/tmp/restore_<uuid>)
  |<----- Upload progress ---------|--- Run integrity checks
  |                                 |--- Restore with progress updates
  |<----- Poll restore status ----->|
  |       (nodes, relationships)    |
  |                                 |--- Delete temp file
  |<----- Complete ----------------|
```

### Key Principles

1. **Client-Side Storage**
   - All backups stored in configured directory (`backup_dir` from config)
   - Default: `~/.local/share/kg/backups`
   - User has full control over backup location
   - Backups survive API server restarts/migrations

2. **Streaming Transfer**
   - Use HTTP chunked transfer encoding
   - No loading entire backup into memory
   - Progress feedback during transfer
   - Support for large backups (100+ MB)

3. **Ephemeral Server Files**
   - Server never stores backups permanently
   - Temp files only during active operation
   - UUID-based temp filenames to avoid conflicts
   - Mandatory cleanup on completion/error

4. **Integrity Checks**
   - Separate module for backup validation
   - Run before restore starts
   - Check format, completeness, external deps
   - Report warnings/issues to user

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - Download/upload progress bars
   - Restore progress (nodes, relationships)
   - Match POC quality (detailed feedback)
   - Poll-based status updates

## Checkpoint Backup Safety Pattern

**Status:** Implemented (Phase 1)
**Date Added:** 2025-10-08

### Problem

Risky graph operations (partial restores, stitching, pruning) can leave the database in an inconsistent state if they fail partway through. Apache AGE doesn't provide native transaction rollback for complex multi-query operations.

### Solution: Automatic Checkpoint Backups

Before executing any potentially destructive operation, create an automatic checkpoint backup:

```python
# Checkpoint safety workflow
1. Create checkpoint: backups/.checkpoint_<timestamp>.json
2. Execute risky operation (stitch/prune/partial restore)
3. Run integrity check
4. On success ‚Üí delete checkpoint
5. On failure ‚Üí auto-restore from checkpoint
```

### Implementation Examples

**Stitching with checkpoint protection:**
```bash
# User runs with --checkpoint flag
python -m src.admin.stitch --backup partial.json --checkpoint

# System automatically:
# 1. Creates .checkpoint_20251008_123045.json (current state)
# 2. Runs stitch operation
# 3. Checks integrity
# 4. If broken ‚Üí restores checkpoint + shows error
# 5. If clean ‚Üí deletes checkpoint + confirms success
```

**Restore with automatic rollback:**
```python
# Before partial restore
checkpoint_file = create_checkpoint_backup()  # Fast, automated

try:
    restore_partial_ontology(backup_data)
    integrity = check_integrity()

    if not integrity.valid:
        # Auto-rollback
        restore_from_backup(checkpoint_file)
        raise RestoreError("Integrity check failed - rolled back to checkpoint")
    else:
        # Success - cleanup checkpoint
        delete_checkpoint(checkpoint_file)

except Exception as e:
    # Any failure ‚Üí restore checkpoint
    restore_from_backup(checkpoint_file)
    raise
```

### Benefits

1. **Transaction-Like Behavior**
   - Risky operations are either fully applied or fully rolled back
   - No partial failures leaving graph in inconsistent state
   - User confidence in trying complex operations

2. **Automatic Protection**
   - No manual backup required before risky operations
   - Checkpoint created/cleaned automatically
   - Invisible to user on success, protective on failure

3. **Fast Operation**
   - Full database backup takes seconds (~5 MB typical)
   - Restore is equally fast
   - Minimal overhead for safety guarantee

4. **User-Friendly**
   - Optional `--checkpoint` flag for user control
   - Clear messaging about rollback if needed
   - Validates before permanent changes

### Design Decisions

**Checkpoint Storage:**
- Location: Same as regular backups (`~/.local/share/kg/backups`)
- Naming: `.checkpoint_<timestamp>.json` (hidden file prefix)
- Cleanup: Auto-delete on success, preserve on failure for inspection
- Retention: Single active checkpoint (overwrite previous)

**When to Use:**
- ‚úÖ Partial ontology restores (external dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Semantic stitching operations (relationship reconnection)
- ‚úÖ Pruning dangling relationships (destructive)
- ‚úÖ Manual graph surgery via admin tools
- ‚ùå Full backups (already safe, just export)
- ‚ùå Read-only operations (integrity check, list, search)

**Integrity Check Integration:**
```python
def safe_operation_with_checkpoint(operation_func, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Execute operation with automatic checkpoint protection.

    Returns:
        Result of operation if successful

    Raises:
        OperationError: If operation fails integrity check (after rollback)
    """
    checkpoint = create_checkpoint()

    try:
        result = operation_func(*args, **kwargs)

        # Validate result
        integrity = check_database_integrity()

        if not integrity.valid:
            restore_from_backup(checkpoint)
            raise IntegrityError(
                f"Operation failed integrity check. "
                f"Database restored to pre-operation state. "
                f"Issues: {integrity.issues}"
            )

        # Success - cleanup
        delete_checkpoint(checkpoint)
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        # Any error - restore checkpoint
        if checkpoint and os.path.exists(checkpoint):
            restore_from_backup(checkpoint)
        raise
```

### Phase 1 Status (Current)

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Full backup/restore working (tested 114 concepts, 5.62 MB)
- Integrity checking functional
- Direct database operations via admin tools

**üìã Remaining:**
- Add `--checkpoint` flag to stitch, prune, restore tools
- Implement automatic checkpoint creation/cleanup
- Add rollback error messaging
- Document checkpoint workflow in user guides

**Future (Phase 2):**
- API-based checkpoint management
- Multi-user coordination (prevent concurrent risky ops)
- Checkpoint retention policies (keep last N failures for debugging)

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Backup Download ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status:** Merged in PR #17 (2025-10-09)

### Phase 3: Integrity Checks ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status:** Implemented with data contract pattern
**Commit:** d0553c4 (2025-10-09)

**Implementation:** `src/api/lib/backup_integrity.py` (175 lines, 72% coverage)

**Usage:**
```python
from src.api.lib.backup_integrity import check_backup_integrity

result = check_backup_integrity("/path/to/backup.json")
if result.valid:
    restore_backup(backup_file)
else:
    for error in result.errors:
        print(f"ERROR: {error.message}")
```

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking üìã PENDING
**Priority:** Medium
**Depends on:** Phase 2 restore worker implementation

**Planned:**
- Use existing job queue pattern from ingestion
- Worker updates progress during restore (nodes, relationships, percent)
- Client polls for progress updates with ora spinner
- Match POC quality (detailed feedback during operations)

### Phase 5: Temp File Cleanup üìã PENDING
**Priority:** High
**Depends on:** Phase 2 restore worker implementation

**Planned:**
- Worker cleanup in finally block (always runs)
- Startup cleanup for abandoned files (>24 hours old)
- UUID-based temp filenames to avoid conflicts

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Backup Download (Implementation)

**Client Changes:**
```typescript
// client/src/api/client.ts
async createBackup(request: BackupRequest): Promise<void> {
  const response = await this.client.post('/admin/backup', request, {
    responseType: 'stream'
  });

  // Stream to configured directory with progress
  const config = getConfig();
  const backupPath = path.join(config.getBackupDir(), filename);

  // Show progress bar
  return streamToFile(response.data, backupPath, (progress) => {
    updateProgressBar(progress);
  });
}
```

**Server Changes:**
```python
# src/api/routes/admin.py
@router.post("/admin/backup")
async def create_backup(request: BackupRequest):
    # Create backup in memory or temp file
    backup_data = await create_backup_data(request)

    # Stream response
    return StreamingResponse(
        backup_generator(backup_data),
        media_type="application/json",
        headers={
            "Content-Disposition": f"attachment; filename={filename}"
        }
    )
```

### Phase 2: Restore Upload (Priority: High)

**Client Changes:**
```typescript
// client/src/api/client.ts
async restoreBackup(request: RestoreRequest, filePath: string): Promise<RestoreResponse> {
  const form = new FormData();
  form.append('file', fs.createReadStream(filePath));
  form.append('username', request.username);
  form.append('password', request.password);

  const response = await this.client.post('/admin/restore', form, {
    headers: form.getHeaders(),
    onUploadProgress: (progressEvent) => {
      updateProgressBar(progressEvent);
    }
  });

  // Poll for restore progress
  return pollRestoreProgress(response.data.job_id);
}
```

**Server Changes:**
```python
# src/api/routes/admin.py
from fastapi import UploadFile

@router.post("/admin/restore")
async def restore_backup(
    file: UploadFile,
    username: str = Form(...),
    password: str = Form(...),
    overwrite: bool = Form(False)
):
    # Authenticate
    if not authenticate(username, password):
        raise HTTPException(401, "Authentication failed")

    # Save to temp location
    temp_path = f"/tmp/restore_{uuid.uuid4()}.json"
    with open(temp_path, "wb") as f:
        shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, f)

    try:
        # Run integrity checks
        integrity = check_backup_integrity(temp_path)
        if not integrity.valid:
            return {"error": integrity.errors}

        # Perform restore with progress tracking
        job_id = enqueue_restore_job(temp_path, overwrite)
        return {"job_id": job_id, "status": "queued"}

    finally:
        # Cleanup happens in worker after restore completes
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Integrity Checks (Priority: Medium)

**Create separate module:**
```python
# src/api/services/integrity_check.py
class BackupIntegrity:
    valid: bool
    errors: List[str]
    warnings: List[str]
    external_deps: int

def check_backup_integrity(backup_path: str) -> BackupIntegrity:
    """
    Validate backup before restore.

    Checks:
    - JSON format validity
    - Required fields present
    - External concept references
    - Data consistency
    """
```

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking (Priority: Medium)

**Use existing job queue pattern:**
```python
# src/api/workers/restore_worker.py
def run_restore_worker(job_data: Dict, job_id: str, job_queue):
    # Update progress during restore
    job_queue.update_job(job_id, {
        "progress": {
            "stage": "restoring_nodes",
            "nodes_restored": 1250,
            "nodes_total": 5000,
            "percent": 25
        }
    })
```

**Client polls for updates:**
```typescript
// Match ingestion progress pattern
const finalJob = await client.pollJob(restoreJobId, (job) => {
  if (job.progress) {
    spinner.text = `Restoring... ${job.progress.percent}% ` +
                   `(${job.progress.nodes_restored}/${job.progress.nodes_total} nodes)`;
  }
});
```

### Phase 5: Temp File Cleanup (Priority: High)

**Cleanup strategy:**
```python
# src/api/workers/restore_worker.py
def run_restore_worker(job_data: Dict, job_id: str, job_queue):
    temp_path = job_data["temp_file"]

    try:
        # Perform restore
        result = restore_from_backup(temp_path)
        return result

    finally:
        # Always cleanup, even on error
        if os.path.exists(temp_path):
            os.unlink(temp_path)
```

**Startup cleanup:**
```python
# src/api/main.py
@app.on_event("startup")
async def cleanup_old_temp_files():
    """Clean up abandoned restore files on startup"""
    temp_dir = "/tmp"
    for file in glob.glob(f"{temp_dir}/restore_*.json"):
        # Delete files older than 24 hours
        if is_older_than(file, hours=24):
            os.unlink(file)
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Proper Separation**
   - Client manages backups locally
   - Server is stateless (no backup storage)
   - Users control backup location via config

2. **Better UX**
   - Progress bars for large operations
   - Local backup management (list, delete, organize)
   - No surprises (backups stored where user expects)

3. **Performance**
   - Streaming prevents memory exhaustion
   - Chunked transfer for large files
   - No artificial size limits

4. **Security**
   - Temp files cleaned up automatically
   - No persistent sensitive data on server
   - Authentication required for restore

5. **Reliability**
   - Backups survive API restarts
   - Client-side backup retention policies
   - Integrity checks before restore

### Negative

1. **Complexity**
   - Multipart upload handling required
   - Progress polling adds complexity
   - More error cases to handle

2. **Migration**
   - Existing server-side backups need migration
   - Users must copy backups to local directory
   - Breaking change for current users

3. **Network**
   - Large backups consume bandwidth
   - Upload time for restore operations
   - Requires stable connection for large files

### Neutral

1. **Storage Location**
   - Client-side storage is standard pattern
   - Aligns with other CLI tools (e.g., Docker, kubectl)
   - User has full control

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Base64 Encoding

**Rejected:** 33% size overhead, memory allocation for encoding/decoding, no progress feedback

```python
# Would require loading entire backup into memory
backup_b64 = base64.b64encode(backup_json)
# 33% larger payload
```

### 2. Server-Side Storage Only

**Rejected:** Violates client-server separation, backups lost on server migration, user has no control

### 3. Both Client and Server Storage

**Rejected:** Unnecessary duplication, sync issues, unclear source of truth

### 4. External Storage (S3, etc.)

**Rejected:** Adds external dependency, complexity for single-user deployments, cost

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users

1. **Backward Compatibility Period:**
   - Keep server-side backup creation for 1 release
   - Add deprecation warning
   - Provide migration script

2. **Migration Script:**
   ```bash
   # scripts/migrate-backups.sh
   # Copy server backups to client directory
   cp ./backups/* ~/.local/share/kg/backups/
   ```

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update README with new backup location
   - Add migration guide
   - Update CLI help text

### Release Plan

**v0.2.0:** (Next Release)
- Phase 1: Backup download
- Phase 2: Restore upload
- Deprecation warnings on old approach

**v0.3.0:** (Following Release)
- Phase 3: Integrity checks
- Phase 4: Progress tracking
- Phase 5: Cleanup improvements

**v0.4.0:** (Future)
- Remove server-side backup storage
- Remove backward compatibility code

## Notes

**Progress Bar Quality:**
The POC backup tool had excellent progress feedback showing:
- Nodes being restored
- Relationships created
- Current operation stage
- Percentage complete

This quality should be maintained in the new implementation. Users appreciate seeing what's happening during long operations.

**Config Integration:**
The backup directory is already configurable via `kg config`:
```bash
kg config list  # Shows backup_dir
kg config set backup_dir /path/to/backups
```

This ADR formalizes using that configured directory as the authoritative backup location.
