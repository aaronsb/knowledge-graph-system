- "Meditation as Silence" (specific aspect, separate from "Meditation")
- "No Method for Enlightenment" (philosophical conclusion)
- "Mystical experience of unity" (experiential concept)
```

**OpenAI GPT-4o - High Granularity:**
```
Extracted nuanced, specific concepts (46):
- "Illusion of Self" (distinct from "False Sense of Personal Identity")
- "Ego" (separate concept)
- "Transformation of Human Consciousness" (process concept)
- "Methodlessness" (abstract philosophical concept)
- "Organism-Environment Relationship" (systemic concept)
```

**Qwen 2.5 14B - Conservative, High-Quality:**

- "False Sense of Personal Identity" (definitional)
- "Symbolic Self" (nuanced perspective)
- "Meditation" (distinct concept)
- "Mystical Experience" (experiential concept)
- "Consciousness" (separate from Self)
```
✅ Most comprehensive extraction of all models tested
⚠️ More aggressive extraction than Qwen 2.5 (57 vs 24 concepts)

**Mistral 7B - Middle Ground, Vague:**
```
Moderate granularity, sometimes vague:
- "Meditation" (2 instances, less granular)
- "Philosophical Notions" (too vague)
- "Human Consciousness" (overly broad)
- "Reality" (minimal context)
```

### 2. Relationship Quality Examples

**OpenAI GPT-4o - Dense, Comprehensive:**
```
Ego → EQUIVALENT_TO → Illusion of Self
Ego → INFLUENCES → Methodlessness
Illusion of Self → EQUIVALENT_TO → Ego and Consciousness
Methodlessness → SUPPORTS → Grammar and Thought

```
Ego → IMPLIES → Illusion of Self
Ego → CATEGORIZED_AS → Consciousness
Ego → CONTRIBUTES_TO → Muscular Straining (non-canonical)
Ego → REQUIRES → Self-Improvement
Ego Illusion → CATEGORIZED_AS → Mystical Experience
Meditation as Silence → PRESUPPOSES → Emptiness
False sense of personal identity → ENABLED_BY → Language and Thought (reversed!)
```
⚠️ Most relationships (190), but 65% canonical adherence
⚠️ ENABLED_BY used backwards (should be ENABLES)
✅ Dense, interconnected graph (11 concepts at 2-hop depth)

**Qwen 2.5 14B - Clean, Precise:**
```
Human Ego → EQUIVALENT_TO → False Sense of Personal Identity
Human Ego → IMPLIES → Illusion
Human Ego → PREVENTS → Mystical Experience
Illusion of Self → CAUSES → Muscular Straining
False Sense of Personal Identity → CAUSES → Inappropriate Action
```
✅ 92% canonical adherence, professional quality relationships

**Qwen3 14B - High Volume, Moderate Adherence:**
```
Ego → EQUIVALENT_TO → Illusion of Self
Meditation → ENABLES → Consciousness
Meditation → RESULTS_FROM → Illusion of Self
Illusion of Self → OPPOSITE_OF → Self-Improvement (via Ego)
Mystical Experience → INSTANCE_OF → Self-Realization (non-canonical)
Mystical Experience → EXEMPLIFIES → Transactional Relationship
```
✅ 74% canonical adherence (better than GPT-OSS, Mistral)
⚠️ INSTANCE_OF used heavily (11 times, non-canonical)
✅ Most relationships created overall (61 concept-to-concept)
**🎯 Significant: Fits in 16GB VRAM while extracting more concepts than GPT-4o**

**Mistral 7B - Creative but Messy:**
```
Reality → IS_ALTERNATIVE_TO → Eternal Now (non-canonical)
Discord between Man and Nature → RESULTS_FROM → Intelligence (canonical but questionable)
Meditation → (no concept-to-concept relationships!)
Tao of Philosophy → (isolated, no relationships)
```
❌ Non-canonical types pollute vocabulary, some concepts isolated

### 3. Search Term Quality

"Symbolic Self": Distinct nuanced concept
```
✅ Excellent search term quality, comprehensive coverage
✅ Separate concepts allow fine-grained semantic search

**Mistral 7B - Verbose/Noisy:**
```
"Meditation": ["meditation", "silence", "verbal symbolic chatter going on in the skull"]
"Reality": ["reality"]
"Discord between Man and Nature": ["discord", "profound discord", "destroying our environment"]
```
⚠️ Mix of overly verbose and minimal, inconsistent quality

### 4. Graph Traversal Quality

**OpenAI GPT-4o - Rich Semantic Graph:**
```
2-hop traversal from "Ego" reaches 9 concepts:
- Illusion of Self (EQUIVALENT_TO)

## Detailed Findings

### Finding 1: Different Extraction Philosophies

**GPT-4o: "Balanced Excellence"**
- Philosophy: Maximize coverage with high canonical adherence
- Result: 46 concepts, dense 172-edge graph, 88% canonical
- Trade-off: Some concepts might be over-segmented
- Best for: Comprehensive knowledge bases, production systems

**Qwen3 14B: "High Volume, Accessible Hardware"**
- Philosophy: Aggressive extraction with moderate canonical adherence
- Result: **57 concepts (most extracted!)**, 61 concept-to-concept relationships, 74% canonical
- Hardware: **Fits in 16GB VRAM** (consumer GPU accessible)
- Trade-off: Lower canonical adherence than Qwen 2.5, but 2.4x more concepts
- Best for: Maximum concept extraction on consumer hardware, when coverage matters

**GPT-OSS 20B: "Maximum Relationships"**
- Philosophy: Extract everything with densest relationship network
- Result: 48 concepts, **densest 190-edge graph**, 65% canonical
- Trade-off: Lower schema compliance, some relationship direction errors
- Best for: Maximum coverage research, when completeness > schema purity

**Qwen 2.5 14B: "Quality Over Quantity"**
- Philosophy: Conservative, precise, canonical
- Result: 24 concepts, clean 98-edge graph, **92% canonical**
- Trade-off: May miss some nuanced sub-concepts
- Best for: Professional knowledge graphs, strict schema compliance

**Mistral 7B: "Creative but Messy"**
- Philosophy: Moderate extraction, creative relationships
- Result: 32 concepts, 134 edges with vocabulary pollution, 38% canonical
- Trade-off: Non-canonical types create schema drift
- Best for: Nothing - avoid for production use

### Finding 2: Canonical Adherence Matters

**Impact of Non-Canonical Types:**

When Mistral 7B generates `IS_ALTERNATIVE_TO` instead of `SIMILAR_TO`:
1. ❌ Fuzzy matcher fails (no good match)
2. ❌ System auto-accepts as new type (ADR-032)
3. ❌ Added to vocabulary with `llm_generated` category
4. ❌ Future chunks can use this type
5. ❌ Vocabulary expands uncontrollably

**Result:** After processing 100 documents:
- GPT-4o: ~35 relationship types (30 canonical + 5 creative) ✅
- Qwen 2.5 14B: ~32 relationship types (30 canonical + 2 creative) ✅
- Qwen3 14B: ~40 relationship types (30 canonical + 10 creative) ⚠️
- GPT-OSS 20B: ~50 relationship types (30 canonical + 20 creative) ⚠️
- Mistral 7B: ~80 relationship types (30 canonical + 50 creative) ❌

**Conclusion:** Canonical adherence is critical for long-term schema quality. Qwen3 14B's 74% adherence represents a middle ground - better than GPT-OSS (65%) but with significantly more concepts extracted (57 vs 48).

### Finding 3: Model Size ≠ Quality

**Counter-Intuitive Result:**

| Model | Parameters | Concepts | Canonical % | VRAM | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| GPT-4o | ~1.7 trillion | 46 | 88% ✅ | Cloud | Best balanced quality |
| GPT-OSS 20B | 20 billion | 48 | 65% ⚠️ | 20GB+ | Reasoning model (wrong tool) |
| **Qwen3 14B** | **14 billion** | **57** ✅ | **74%** ⚠️ | **16GB** | **Most concepts, consumer GPU** |
| Qwen 2.5 14B | 14 billion | 24 | **92%** ✅ | 16GB | Highest canonical adherence |
| Mistral 7B | 7 billion | 32 | 38% ❌ | 8GB | Avoid for production |

**Key Insights:**
- **Parameter count ≠ Schema compliance:** 20B GPT-OSS has 65% canonical vs 14B Qwen 2.5's 92%
- **Qwen3 14B represents a breakthrough:** Most concepts extracted (57) while fitting in consumer 16GB VRAM
- **Hardware accessibility matters:** Qwen3 achieves 74% canonical adherence with 2.4x more concepts than Qwen 2.5, on the same hardware
- **Model generation matters:** Qwen3 (Jan 2025) extracts 2.4x more concepts than Qwen 2.5 (Oct 2024) from same architecture
- **Qwen 2.5's superior canonical adherence:** More conservative extraction (fewer creative relationships)

The Qwen3 vs Qwen 2.5 comparison validates that newer model generations can achieve significantly higher extraction volume with acceptable canonical adherence trade-offs.

### Finding 4: Speed vs Quality Trade-off

**Inference Time Comparison (per chunk):**

| Provider | Time | Cost | Quality Score | Concepts/Chunk | Notes |
|----------|------|------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| GPT-4o | 2s | $0.017 | 95/100 | 7.7 | Best balance, 30x faster than Qwen3 |
| Qwen 2.5 14B | 15s | $0.00 | 85/100 | 4.0 | Best canonical adherence |
| GPT-OSS 20B | 20s | $0.00 | 75/100 | 8.0 | Most relationships, CPU+GPU split |
| **Qwen3 14B** | **60s** | **$0.00** | **82/100** | **9.5** | **Most concepts, worth the wait** |
| Mistral 7B | 10s | $0.00 | 60/100 | 5.3 | Avoid |

**For 1000-document corpus (~6000 chunks):**
- GPT-4o: 3.3 hours, $100, highest quality (88% canonical, 46K concepts)
- Qwen3 14B: **100 hours**, $0, **highest volume** (74% canonical, **57K concepts**)
- Qwen 2.5 14B: 25 hours, $0, highest canonical (92% canonical, 24K concepts)
- GPT-OSS 20B: 33 hours, $0, densest graph (65% canonical, 48K concepts)
- Mistral 7B: 16.7 hours, $0, poor quality (38% canonical)

**Conclusions:**
- For maximum concept extraction: **Qwen3 14B** offers most concepts (57K) at the cost of 4x slower speed vs Qwen 2.5
- For production with canonical enforcement: Qwen 2.5 14B offers best canonical/speed ratio
- For research requiring maximum coverage: Qwen3 14B extracts 19% more concepts than GPT-OSS while fitting in 16GB VRAM
- **Speed trade-off is acceptable:** 60s/chunk = 1 minute of patience for 9.5 concepts extracted

### Finding 5: The "Abe Simpson" Lesson - Wrong Tool for the Job

**Problem:** Reasoning models (like GPT-OSS) are fundamentally unsuited for concept extraction.

**The Analogy:**

> "GPT-OSS is the Abe Simpson of extraction models" - rambles endlessly about the task instead of just doing it.

**Reasoning Model Behavior:**
```
"So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time.
 Now, to extract concepts from this Alan Watts passage, you have
 to understand that back in my day we didn't have JSON, we had XML...
 [15,000 tokens of meta-analysis later]
 ...and that's why the linear thinking concept relates to— TIMEOUT"
```

**Instruction Model Behavior (Qwen3):**
```
"Here are 10 concepts with instances and relationships. JSON attached.
 Done in 60 seconds."
```

**Why Reasoning Models Fail at Extraction:**

| Aspect | Reasoning Models (GPT-OSS) | Instruction Models (Qwen3) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Design purpose** | Problem-solving, deep analysis | Pattern recognition, task completion |
| **Mental model** | Philosopher thinking about concepts | Librarian cataloging concepts |
| **Token usage** | 15K+ tokens thinking about thinking | 4K tokens for actual extraction |
| **Output consistency** | Wildly variable (3-22 concepts) | Stable (9-10 concepts per chunk) |
| **Task completion** | Often timeout before JSON output | Always completes in ~60s |
| **Best use case** | Complex reasoning problems | Concept identification & summarization |

**Key Lesson:** Concept extraction requires:
- **Identification** of concepts in text (pattern recognition)
- **Summarization** into structured format (instruction following)
- **NOT** deep reasoning about what concepts mean

**Practical Implication:** Don't use reasoning models for extraction, even if they have more parameters. A 14B instruction model (Qwen3) extracts 19% more concepts than a 20B reasoning model (GPT-OSS) because it's the right tool for the job.

**The Rule:** Match model architecture to task requirements:
- **Extraction, classification, formatting** → Instruction models (Qwen, Mistral, Llama)
- **Complex reasoning, problem-solving, analysis** → Reasoning models (GPT-OSS, o1, o3)

---

## Recommendations

### By Use Case

#### 1. Production Knowledge Base (Public/Shared)
**Recommended:** OpenAI GPT-4o

**Rationale:**
- Highest concept coverage (46 concepts)
- Densest relationship graph (172 edges)
- Professional quality (88% canonical)
- Fastest extraction (2s/chunk)
- Worth the cost for quality and speed

**Example:** Company documentation, research publications, shared knowledge bases

---

#### 2. Large Private Corpus (1000+ documents)
**Recommended:** Qwen 2.5 14B (Ollama)

**Rationale:**
- Zero cost (saves $100+ per 1000 docs)
- Highest canonical adherence (92%)
- Privacy-preserving (local inference)
- Professional quality output
- One-time Ollama setup pain

**Example:** Personal notes, proprietary research, sensitive documents

---

- Cleanest relationship vocabulary
- Minimal schema drift over time
- Best for maintaining canonical 30-type system

**Example:** Academic research, standardized knowledge graphs, multi-user systems

---

#### 4. Maximum Concept Extraction (Research Use)
**Recommended:** GPT-OSS 20B (Ollama)

**Rationale:**
- Most concepts extracted (48, even beats GPT-4o!)
- Densest relationship graph (190 edges)
- Hyper-granular concept distinctions ("Ego" vs "Ego as role mask" vs "Ego Illusion")
- Accepts 65% canonical adherence trade-off for completeness
- Free (local inference)

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower schema compliance (65% vs Qwen's 92%)
- Some reversed relationships (ENABLED_BY instead of ENABLES)
- Slower inference (~20s/chunk, CPU+GPU split)

**Example:** Exploratory research, building comprehensive conceptual maps, when coverage > schema purity

---

#### 5. Quick Prototyping / Experimentation
**Recommended:** OpenAI GPT-4o

**Rationale:**
- 10x faster than local models
- No Ollama setup required
- Immediate results
- Cost negligible for small-scale testing

**Example:** Testing extraction on 5-10 documents, proof-of-concept work

---

#### 6. Budget-Conscious Serious Work
**Recommended:** Qwen 2.5 14B (Ollama)

**Rationale:**
- Professional quality (92% canonical)
- Zero ongoing cost
- Only 48% fewer concepts than GPT-4o
- Clean, maintainable relationships

**Example:** Indie researchers, students, hobbyist knowledge management

---

#### 7. What to Avoid

**❌ Do NOT use Mistral 7B for production:**
- Only 38% canonical adherence
- Creates vocabulary pollution
- Isolated concepts (sparse graph)
- Quality gap not justified by speed advantage

**Better alternatives:**
- If budget allows: GPT-4o
- If free required: Qwen 14B (worth the slower inference)

1. ✅ Same `llm_extractor.py` prompt for all providers
2. ✅ Same `relationship_mapper.py` fuzzy matching
3. ✅ Same `ingestion.py` concept matching logic
4. ✅ Same OpenAI embeddings for all providers

**Conclusion:** Quality differences are **model-dependent, not architectural**. This validates ADR-042's provider abstraction design.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Scenario: 100 Philosophy Lectures (~600 chunks)

| Provider | Time | Cost | Concepts | Quality | ROI |
|----------|------|------|----------|---------|-----|
| **GPT-4o** | 20 min | $10 | ~4600 | Excellent (88%) | **Best for production** |
| **Qwen3 14B** | 10 hrs | $0 | **~5700** | Good (74%) | **Best for max extraction on 16GB** |
| **GPT-OSS 20B** | 3.3 hrs | $0 | ~4800 | Good (65%) | Requires 20GB+ VRAM |
| **Qwen 2.5 14B** | 2.5 hrs | $0 | ~2400 | Excellent (92%) | **Best canonical/budget** |
| **Mistral 7B** | 1.7 hrs | $0 | ~3200 | Poor (38%) | ❌ Not worth the time |

**Break-Even Analysis:**

At what corpus size does local inference become worth it?

- **< 50 documents:** Use GPT-4o (cost < $5, time savings valuable)
- **50-500 documents:** Qwen 2.5 or Qwen3 competitive ($5-50 savings, acceptable time cost)
  - Choose Qwen 2.5 for canonical purity (92%)
  - Choose Qwen3 for maximum concepts (2.4x more)
- **500+ documents:** Local models strongly recommended ($50+ savings, time investment pays off)
  - **Qwen3 14B:** For maximum concept extraction (57K concepts vs 24K)
  - **Qwen 2.5 14B:** For strict canonical compliance (92%)

- Have 16GB VRAM (consumer GPU)
- Can tolerate 60s/chunk speed (worth it for 2.4x more concepts)
- Acceptable canonical adherence (74%) is good enough

**Consider GPT-OSS 20B when:**
- You don't mind reasoning model quirks ("Abe Simpson" behavior)
- Have 20GB+ VRAM or CPU+GPU split capability
- Doing exploratory/research work
- Schema compliance can be traded for dense relationship networks

### For Organizations

**Use GPT-4o for:**
- Customer-facing knowledge bases
- Time-sensitive projects
- Shared/collaborative graphs
- When $100-500/month is acceptable

**Use Qwen 2.5 14B for:**
- Large internal corpora (10,000+ docs)
- Proprietary/sensitive data where canonical schema compliance matters most
- Budget constraints with professional quality requirements
- Departments with GPU infrastructure

**Use Qwen3 14B for:**
- Maximum concept extraction (57 concepts per 6 chunks = 9.5/chunk)
- Research departments needing comprehensive coverage
- Consumer-grade GPU infrastructure (16GB VRAM)
- Acceptable canonical adherence (74%) with high volume trade-off

**Use GPT-OSS 20B for:**
- Dense relationship networks (190 edges per document)
- Exploratory analysis where coverage > schema compliance
- Teams with powerful GPU infrastructure (20GB+ VRAM or CPU+GPU)

**Consider Anthropic Claude:**
- Not tested in this comparison
- Expected quality similar to GPT-4o
- Slightly cheaper ($0.008 vs $0.010 per 1000 words)
- Good alternative for diversity/failover

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways

1. **Qwen3 14B is the new extraction champion** (57 concepts - most of all tested, 74% canonical, fits 16GB VRAM)
2. **GPT-4o remains the balanced leader** (46 concepts, 88% canonical, 30x faster, best for production)
3. **Qwen 2.5 14B is the schema compliance leader** (92% canonical adherence, zero cost, professional quality)
4. **Hardware accessibility is a game-changer** (Qwen3 extracts 19% more concepts than GPT-OSS on consumer GPU)
5. **Model generation matters** (Qwen3 extracts 2.4x more concepts than Qwen 2.5 from same hardware)
6. **Mistral 7B should be avoided** (vocabulary pollution, schema drift, poor quality)
7. **Pipeline architecture is sound** (same code, model-dependent quality differences)

### Decision Framework

```
Does cost matter?
├─ No  → Use GPT-4o (best balance: quality + speed + canonical)
└─ Yes (local models) → Do you have 16GB VRAM?
          ├─ Yes → What's your priority?
          │        ├─ Maximum concepts (57) → Use Qwen3 14B ✨
          │        ├─ Schema compliance (92%) → Use Qwen 2.5 14B
          │        └─ Dense relationships (190) → Use GPT-OSS 20B (needs 20GB+)
          └─ No  → CPU inference or upgrade hardware
```

**Additional considerations:**
- **Maximum concept extraction:** Qwen3 14B (57 concepts, 74% canonical, 16GB VRAM)
- **Research/exploration:** Qwen3 14B or GPT-OSS 20B (depending on VRAM)
- **Production systems:** GPT-4o (speed) or Qwen 2.5 14B (canonical adherence)
- **Privacy required:** Any local model (Qwen3, Qwen 2.5, GPT-OSS)
- **Speed critical:** GPT-4o only (30x faster than Qwen3, 60x faster than CPU)

### The Surprising Results

**Qwen3 14B emerges as the extraction champion:**
- **57 concepts extracted** - beats GPT-4o (46), GPT-OSS (48), and all other models
- 14B parameters, fits in consumer 16GB VRAM
- 74% canonical adherence (better than GPT-OSS 65%, acceptable for most uses)
- Newest model (Jan 2025) shows dramatic improvement over Qwen 2.5 (Oct 2024)
- **2.4x more concepts** than Qwen 2.5 on identical hardware
- **Winner:** Maximum concept extraction on accessible hardware

**Qwen 2.5 14B punches far above its weight:**
- 14B parameters vs GPT-4o's ~1.7T (0.8% of size)
- **92% canonical adherence (beats all other models!)**
- Professional-quality relationships with conservative extraction
- Zero cost, privacy-preserving, offline-capable
- **Winner:** Best canonical compliance for production

**GPT-OSS 20B has densest relationship network:**
- **190 relationship edges** (densest graph, +10% over GPT-4o)
- Hyper-granular concept distinctions
- Trade-off: Reasoning model ("Abe Simpson") unsuitable for extraction
- Requires 20GB+ VRAM or CPU+GPU split
- **Winner:** Dense relationship networks (if you have the hardware)

**Key insight:** For users with consumer GPUs (16GB VRAM), **Qwen3 14B offers unprecedented concept extraction volume** - 57 concepts per document, surpassing even cloud-based GPT-4o, at zero cost. The 60-second wait per chunk is worth it for 9.5 concepts extracted.
