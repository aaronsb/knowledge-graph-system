# Features

The Knowledge Graph System transforms documents into interconnected concept graphs. Five interfaces give you access to the same powerful capabilities — choose the one that fits your workflow.

## Choose Your Interface

| If you want to... | Use |
|-------------------|-----|
| Explore visually, see clusters and relationships | [Web Workstation](web-workstation.md) |
| Script batch operations, integrate with CI/CD | [CLI Tool](cli.md) |
| Give AI assistants access to your knowledge | [MCP Server](mcp-server.md) |
| Browse knowledge like files with `ls` and `grep` | [FUSE Driver](fuse-driver.md) |
| Build custom applications | [REST API](rest-api.md) |

## What You Can Do

### Build Knowledge Graphs
Feed the system research papers, notes, documentation, images. It extracts key concepts, discovers relationships, and builds a queryable graph. Supports text, PDFs, and images with vision AI.

### Search Semantically
Find concepts by meaning, not keywords. Ask "what causes price increases" and find concepts about inflation, supply chains, and monetary policy — even without exact word matches.

### Discover Connections
Find how concepts relate. Trace the path from "supply chain disruption" to "consumer prices" through your knowledge graph. Every relationship includes evidence from source documents.

### Analyze Dimensions
Map concepts onto semantic spectrums. See where "Agile" falls between "Modern" and "Traditional". Discover which concepts balance opposing viewpoints.

### Validate Knowledge
Every relationship has a grounding strength score based on evidence. See which connections are well-supported across multiple sources versus mentioned once.

### Curate and Refine
Create, edit, and delete concepts directly. Correct extraction errors, merge duplicates, add domain expert knowledge that the AI missed.
