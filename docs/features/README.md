# Features

The Knowledge Graph System transforms documents into interconnected concept graphs. Here's what it can do.

## Knowledge Extraction

**[Document Ingestion](../manual/01-getting-started/03-INGESTION.md)** — Feed the system research papers, notes, documentation. It extracts key concepts, finds relationships, and builds a queryable graph. Supports text, PDFs, and images with vision AI.

## Search & Discovery

**[Semantic Search](./semantic-search/)** — Find concepts by meaning, not keywords. Ask "what causes price increases" and find concepts about inflation, even without exact word matches.

**Path Finding** — Discover how concepts connect. Find the chain of relationships between "supply chain disruption" and "consumer prices" through your knowledge graph.

**[Document Search](../reference/mcp/)** — Search at the document level. Find which sources discuss a topic, with highlighted passages showing where concepts were extracted.

## Analysis & Visualization

**[Polarity Axis Analysis](./polarity-axis-analysis/)** — Map concepts onto semantic spectrums. See where "Agile" falls on Modern ↔ Traditional, or discover which concepts balance opposing viewpoints.

**Embedding Landscape** — Visualize your entire knowledge graph in 3D. See concept clusters, explore neighborhoods, identify gaps in coverage.

**Grounding Strength** — Every relationship has an evidence score. See which connections are well-supported across multiple sources versus mentioned once.

## Knowledge Management

**Vocabulary Control** — The system learns relationship types from your documents. Review, merge, or prune edge types to keep your graph clean and meaningful.

**Ontology Organization** — Group documents into ontologies (knowledge domains). Search within a domain or across your entire collection.

**Concept CRUD** — Create, update, and delete concepts directly. Build graph structure manually or augment what the AI extracted.

## Integration

**REST API** — Full programmatic access to all features. Build custom applications on top of your knowledge graph.

**CLI Tool** — Command-line interface for power users. Script ingestion workflows, run batch operations, manage the system.

**MCP Server** — Model Context Protocol integration. Let AI assistants query your knowledge graph directly.

**Web Interface** — Visual workspaces for exploration, ingestion, and administration.
