# 01 - What Is a Knowledge Graph?

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Part:** I - Foundations  
**Reading Time:** ~15 minutes

## Goal

Introduce the fundamental concept of knowledge graphs and explain why they're valuable for learning and knowledge management. Answer: "What problem does this solve that other approaches don't?"

## Source Materials

- `reference/CONCEPT.md` (164 lines) - "Why Knowledge Graphs, Not Just RAG?"
- `reference/CONCEPTS_AND_TERMINOLOGY.md` (first 200 lines) - Core concepts
- `reference/ENRICHMENT_JOURNEY.md` - Real example of multi-perspective learning

## Outline

1. **The Linear Problem**
   - How we traditionally read and store knowledge
   - The limitation of sequential documents
   - Information buried in time-order (commit history, lecture series)

2. **Graph Thinking**
   - Knowledge as interconnected concepts, not linear text
   - Multiple entry points, multiple pathways
   - Emergence of patterns across documents

3. **Why Not Just RAG?**
   - RAG retrieves similar text chunks
   - Knowledge graphs reveal relationships and structure
   - Multi-hop reasoning and path finding

4. **What You'll Build**
   - Preview of the system capabilities
   - Teaser for real-world examples in later sections

## TODO

- [ ] Port opening from CONCEPT.md
- [ ] Create simple diagram: Linear vs Graph
- [ ] Add concrete example (before/after)
- [ ] Link to Section 07 (real-world example)
