### search

Search for concepts using semantic similarity. Your ENTRY POINT to the graph.

RETURNS RICH DATA FOR EACH CONCEPT:
- Grounding strength (-1.0 to 1.0): Reliability/contradiction score
- Diversity score: Conceptual richness (% of diverse connections)
- Authenticated diversity: Support vs contradiction indicator (✅✓⚠❌)
- Evidence samples: Quoted text from source documents
- Image indicators: Visual evidence when available
- Document sources: Where concepts originated

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW: After search, use concept (action: "connect") to find HOW concepts relate - this reveals narrative flows and cause/effect chains that individual searches cannot show. Connection paths are often more valuable than isolated concepts.

Use 2-3 word phrases (e.g., "linear thinking patterns").

**Parameters:**

- `query` (`string`) **(required)** - Search query text (2-3 word phrases work best, e.g., "linear thinking patterns")
- `limit` (`number`) - Maximum number of results to return (default: 10, max: 100)
  - Default: `10`
- `min_similarity` (`number`) - Minimum similarity score 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.7 for 70%, lower to 0.5-0.6 for broader matches)
  - Default: `0.7`
- `offset` (`number`) - Number of results to skip for pagination (default: 0)
  - Default: `0`
