# Knowledge Graph System - Integration Test Plan

**Purpose:** Comprehensive end-to-end validation of the knowledge graph system after ADR-044/045/046 implementation.

**Branch:** `refactor/embedding-grounding-system`

**Date Created:** 2025-01-25

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and docker-compose installed
- Python 3.11+ with venv
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- kg CLI installed globally (`cd client && ./install.sh`)
- API keys configured (OpenAI or Anthropic)

### Clean Environment Checklist
- [ ] Stop all running containers: `docker-compose down -v`
- [ ] Remove volumes: `docker volume prune`
- [ ] Clean API logs: `rm -f logs/api_*.log`
- [ ] Fresh Python venv: `rm -rf venv && python3 -m venv venv`

---

## Phase 1: Cold Start & Schema Validation

### 1.1 Database Initialization
```bash
# Start fresh PostgreSQL + AGE
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for database ready
docker logs knowledge-graph-postgres | grep "ready to accept connections"

# Apply migrations
./scripts/migrate-db.sh --dry-run  # Preview
./scripts/migrate-db.sh -y         # Apply
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] PostgreSQL container running
- [ ] Apache AGE extension loaded
- [ ] All migrations applied successfully
- [ ] No migration errors in logs

### 1.2 Schema Audit
```bash
# List all tables
docker exec knowledge-graph-postgres psql -U postgres -d knowledge_graph -c "\dt ag_catalog.*"
docker exec knowledge-graph-postgres psql -U postgres -d knowledge_graph -c "\dt public.*"
```

**Expected Tables:**
- `public.embeddings` - Unified embedding cache (ADR-045)
- `public.vocabulary` - Relationship types with embeddings (ADR-046)
- `public.jobs` - Ingestion job queue
- `public.sources` - Source file metadata
- `public.schema_migrations` - Migration tracking
- `ag_catalog.*` - Apache AGE graph tables

**Verify:**
- [ ] No old/unused tables (e.g., old `concept_embeddings` table should be migrated)
- [ ] All expected tables exist
- [ ] Vocabulary table has SUPPORTS/CONTRADICTS prototypes

### 1.3 API Server Startup
```bash
# Configure AI provider
./scripts/configure-ai.sh

# Start API
./scripts/start-api.sh

# Check health
kg health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] API server starts without errors
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] EmbeddingWorker initialized (check logs)
- [ ] VocabularyScorer initialized (check logs)

---

## Phase 2: Content Ingestion

### 2.1 Test Data Preparation
Create test documents:
```bash
cat > /tmp/test-doc-1.txt <<'EOF'
# Problem Statement
The current configuration management system is manual and error-prone.
It requires ScriptRunner which is a proprietary tool with licensing costs.

# Proposed Solution
Implement atlassian-operator as a REST API-based configuration compiler.
This provides Infrastructure-as-Code for Atlassian platform management.

# Benefits
- Automated configuration management
- Version control for infrastructure
- Reduced manual effort
EOF

cat > /tmp/test-doc-2.txt <<'EOF'
# Apache AGE Benefits
Apache AGE provides graph database capabilities on top of PostgreSQL.
It supports openCypher query language for graph traversal.

# Integration Approach
The knowledge graph system uses AGE for concept storage and relationship mapping.
This enables semantic search and path finding between concepts.
EOF
```

### 2.2 Ingestion Test - Ontology A (OpenAI Embeddings)
```bash
# Ensure using OpenAI
kg admin extraction set --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# Ingest test document 1
kg ingest file -o "TestOntologyA" -y /tmp/test-doc-1.txt

# Monitor job progress
kg jobs list
kg job status <job-id>
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Job completes successfully
- [ ] Concepts extracted (check: `kg database stats`)
- [ ] Embeddings cached in `embeddings` table
- [ ] Vocabulary populated with relationship types
- [ ] Grounding strength calculated for concepts

### 2.3 Ingestion Test - Ontology B (Local Embeddings - Optional)
```bash
# Switch to local embeddings (if Ollama available)
kg admin extraction set --embeddings local

# Ingest test document 2
kg ingest file -o "TestOntologyB" -y /tmp/test-doc-2.txt
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Job completes with local embeddings
- [ ] Embeddings in cache use local provider
- [ ] Search still works across both ontologies

### 2.4 Data Verification
```sql
-- Check concepts created
docker exec knowledge-graph-postgres psql -U postgres -d knowledge_graph <<EOF
SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('knowledge_graph', $$
  MATCH (c:Concept) RETURN c.label, c.concept_id LIMIT 10
$$) as (label agtype, concept_id agtype);
EOF

-- Check embeddings cache
docker exec knowledge-graph-postgres psql -U postgres -d knowledge_graph -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM embeddings;"

-- Check vocabulary
docker exec knowledge-graph-postgres psql -U postgres -d knowledge_graph -c "SELECT relationship_type, support_weight FROM vocabulary ORDER BY relationship_type;"
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Concepts exist in graph
- [ ] Embeddings cached (count > 0)
- [ ] Vocabulary has entries (SUPPORTS, CONTRADICTS, etc.)
- [ ] Support weights are reasonable (SUPPORTS > 0, CONTRADICTS < 0)

---

## Phase 3: Query Testing

### 3.1 CLI Query Tests
```bash
# Search
kg search query "configuration management" --limit 5

# With evidence
kg search query "configuration management" --show-evidence

# Details
CONCEPT_ID=$(kg search query "configuration management" --json | jq -r '.results[0].concept_id')
kg search details $CONCEPT_ID

# Connection
kg search connect "configuration management" "atlassian operator"

# With evidence
kg search connect "configuration management" "atlassian operator" --show-evidence

# Related concepts
kg search related $CONCEPT_ID --depth 2

# JSON output mode
kg search query "Apache AGE" --json | jq .
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Search returns results with grounding strength
- [ ] Evidence display works (--show-evidence)
- [ ] Grounding strength shown automatically
- [ ] Connection paths found
- [ ] Related concepts discovered
- [ ] JSON mode works for all commands

# Test extraction still works
kg admin extraction test
```

### 4.2 Re-ingest Same Content
```bash
# Ingest same doc into new ontology
kg ingest file -o "TestOntologyC" -y /tmp/test-doc-1.txt
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Ingestion succeeds with new embedder
- [ ] Search works across ontologies with different embedders
- [ ] Concepts semantically similar despite different embeddings
- [ ] Vocabulary remains consistent

- [ ] Vocabulary integrity maintained (entries used by other ontologies still present)
- [ ] Search in remaining ontologies still works

### 5.3 Graph Integrity Check
```bash
# Verify no orphaned nodes
kg database stats

# Check graph structure
kg search query "Apache AGE"  # Should still work for TestOntologyB
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] No orphaned Source or Instance nodes

- [ ] Relationships updated in graph
- [ ] Grounding calculations still work
- [ ] No broken relationships

### 6.3 Vocabulary Cleanup
```bash
# List all vocabulary entries
kg vocab list
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] No obvious duplicates
- [ ] Weights are reasonable
- [ ] All entries have embeddings

---

## Phase 7: Backup & Restore (âœ… COMPLETED - 2025-01-26)

**Schema Versioning Implemented:** Migration 013 adds schema version tracking to all backups

### 7.1 Create Backup
```bash
# Backup full database
kg admin backup --type full

# Backup specific ontology
kg admin backup --type ontology --ontology "TestOntologyB"

# List backups
ls -lh ~/.local/share/kg/backups/
```

**Verify:**
- [x] Backup file created with schema_version field
- [x] Backup includes metadata (version, timestamp, ontology, schema_version: 13)
- [x] Backup includes all data (concepts, sources, instances, relationships, vocabulary)
- [x] Backup file size reasonable (JSON serialization)

### 7.2 Schema Version Validation
```bash
# Check backup metadata
head -20 ~/.local/share/kg/backups/<backup_file>.json | grep -E '"version"|"schema_version"|"type"'
```

**Verify:**
- [x] Backup includes "schema_version": 13 (current migration number)
- [x] Backup includes "version": "1.0" (backup format version)
- [x] Backup type correctly identified (full_backup or ontology_backup)

### 7.3 Complete Backup/Restore Cycle Test
```bash
# Create unique test data
cat > /tmp/purple-elephant-test.txt <<'EOF'
Purple Elephant Migration Pattern
A whimsical software architecture pattern for data migration.
Features trunk-based data transfer and herd coordination.
EOF

# Ingest unique test data
kg ingest file --ontology "PurpleElephantTest" /tmp/purple-elephant-test.txt --wait

# Search BEFORE deletion (should find it)
kg search query "purple elephant" --min-similarity 0.7

# Create backup
kg admin backup --type ontology --ontology "PurpleElephantTest"

# Delete ontology
kg ontology delete "PurpleElephantTest" --force

# Search AFTER deletion (should NOT find it)
kg search query "purple elephant" --min-similarity 0.7  # Should return 0 concepts

# Restore from backup (DEFAULT behavior: creates new concepts)
kg admin restore --file purpleelephanttest_backup_*.json

# Search AFTER restore (should find it again!)
kg search query "purple elephant" --min-similarity 0.7  # Should return Purple Elephant
```

**Verify:**
- [x] Data found before deletion
- [x] Data completely gone after deletion (0 concepts)
- [x] Data returns after restore
- [x] Concepts searchable with original similarity scores
- [x] Evidence and relationships intact

### 7.4 Safety Check: Existing Ontology Protection
```bash
# Try to restore when ontology already exists (should ERROR)
kg admin restore --file purpleelephanttest_backup_*.json

# Expected error: "Ontology 'PurpleElephantTest' already exists. Use --merge flag..."
```

**Verify:**
- [x] Error message shown if ontology exists
- [x] Prevents accidental overwrite
- [x] Clear guidance to use --merge flag

### 7.5 Merge Mode Test
```bash
# Restore with --merge flag (merges into existing ontology)
kg admin restore --file purpleelephanttest_backup_*.json --merge

# Should succeed and stitch concepts into existing graph
```

**Verify:**
- [x] Restore succeeds with --merge flag
- [x] Concepts matched to existing ones (stitching behavior)
- [x] Evidence added to matched concepts
- [x] No duplicate concept nodes created

### 7.6 Type Safety Validation
**Issue Fixed:** VARCHAR[] vs JSONB mismatch for synonyms field

```bash
# Verify vocabulary with synonyms can be backed up and restored
kg admin backup --type full
kg admin restore --file <backup_file>.json --merge
```

**Verify:**
- [x] No type mismatch errors during restore
- [x] Vocabulary synonyms restored correctly (VARCHAR[] arrays)
- [x] Embeddings restored with correct JSON format

### 7.7 Data Integrity Check
```bash
# Compare concept counts before/after
kg database stats
```

**Verify:**
- [x] Source count matches expected
- [x] Instance count matches expected
- [x] Relationship count intact
- [x] Concepts accessible via search
- [x] Grounding calculations work post-restore
