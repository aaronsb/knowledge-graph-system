## Issues & Investigations

### Issue #1: AGE Extension Health Check Warning
**Severity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (Informational)
**Command:** `kg database health`
**Status:** Database functional but reports degraded

**Output:**
```
Status: ‚ö† DEGRADED

Health Checks:
  connectivity: ok
  age_extension: ‚ö† error  ‚Üê This
  graph: ‚úì ok
```

**Impact:**
- Database is working normally
- Ingestion successful
- Graph queries functional
- Likely a false positive in health check logic

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check what health check is being performed for `age_extension`
2. Review `src/api/routes/database.py` health endpoint
3. Verify AGE extension is actually loaded:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'age';
   ```
4. Check if this is a reserved word issue (like our earlier bugs)

**Files to Review:**
- `src/api/routes/database.py` (health endpoint)
- `src/api/lib/age_client.py` (health check logic)

---

### Issue #2: Scheduler Status API 500 Error
**Severity:** üî¥ High (Broken Feature)
**Command:** `kg admin scheduler status`
**Error:** Request failed with status code 500

**Impact:**
- Cannot view scheduler configuration
- Cannot verify cleanup settings
- Scheduler functionality unknown (but ingestion works)

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check API server logs for traceback:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/api_*.log | grep -A 20 "scheduler"
   ```
2. Review endpoint implementation:
   - `src/api/routes/admin.py` - scheduler status endpoint
   - `src/api/services/job_queue.py` - scheduler implementation
3. Test endpoint directly:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/admin/scheduler/status
   ```
4. Check for reserved word conflicts in status query

**Hypothesis:**
- Likely a database query syntax error (like our earlier `count`/`exists` bugs)
- Or missing scheduler implementation in API

**Files to Review:**
- `src/api/routes/admin.py`
- `src/api/services/job_queue.py`
- API server logs

### Finding #3: Search Returns Zero Results
**Severity:** üü° Informational
**Command:** `kg search query "human intelligence"`
**Result:** 0 concepts found

**Context:**
- Database has 7 concepts from Watts lecture on "human intelligence"
- Text includes multiple mentions of "human intelligence limitation"

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Embedding mismatch** - Search term embedding doesn't match stored embeddings
2. **Similarity threshold too high** - Default threshold may be > 0.85
3. **Concept labels different** - LLM may have extracted as "intelligence limitations" instead
4. **Vector search disabled** - Needs verification

**Investigation Needed:**
1. List all concept labels to see what was extracted:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (c:Concept) RETURN c.label, c.concept_id
   ```
2. Test with a known exact concept label
3. Try lower similarity threshold:
   ```bash
   kg search query "linear" --min-similarity 0.5
   ```
4. Check if embeddings were generated:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (c:Concept) RETURN c.concept_id, size(c.embedding)
   ```

**Files to Review:**
- `client/src/cli/search.ts` (search implementation)
- `src/api/routes/queries.py` (search endpoint)
- `src/api/lib/age_client.py` (vector_search method)

## Positive Findings

### ‚úÖ 30-Type Relationship Taxonomy Fully Operational

The new relationship system from PR#24 is working perfectly:

**Evidence:**
```bash
kg database stats
```
Shows 5 distinct types from the new taxonomy:
- `CONTRASTS_WITH` (similarity category)
- `CATEGORIZED_AS` (meta category)
- `DEFINED_AS` (meta category)
- `RESULTS_FROM` (causal category)
- `USED_FOR` (functional category)

**Validation:** Zero "invalid relationship type" errors during ingestion ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Table Formatting System (ADR-019)

All list commands show clean, aligned tables:
- `kg ontology list`
- `kg jobs list`
- `kg database stats`

Formatting is consistent and professional.

### ‚úÖ Job Approval Workflow (ADR-014)

Jobs system shows detailed cost estimates and progress tracking:
- Pre-ingestion analysis with token estimates
- Real-time progress updates
- Final cost breakdown

## Test Coverage

### Tested Commands (15/25) - 60%

‚úÖ Fully tested:
- health
- config list
- database stats/info/health
- ontology list/info
- jobs list/status
- admin status
- ingest file

‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped (require specific data):
- search details/related/connect (need concept IDs)
- config get/set/delete
- ontology files (need multi-file ontology)
- admin scheduler cleanup

‚ùå Not tested (per requirements):
- admin backup
- admin restore

### Test Environment

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.10 + Apache AGE (healthy)
- **API Server:** Running with hot reload
- **Python:** 3.13.7
- **Data:** 1 ontology (CleanTest), 7 concepts, 6 relationships
- **Jobs:** 20 historical jobs (mix of completed/failed)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Scheduler Status Error
**Why:** Broken API endpoint (500 error)
**Action:** Debug `/admin/scheduler/status` endpoint
**Effort:** 30-60 minutes

### Priority 2: Investigate AGE Health Check
**Why:** Confusing "degraded" status when DB is healthy
**Action:** Review health check logic, possibly fix or remove check
**Effort:** 15-30 minutes

### Priority 3: Verify Vector Search Behavior
**Why:** Search returns 0 results unexpectedly
**Action:** List concepts, test with exact labels, check embeddings
**Effort:** 15-30 minutes

### Priority 4: Test Remaining Commands
**Why:** Complete coverage for confidence
**Action:** Ingest multi-file ontology, test all search commands
**Effort:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Issue #2** (scheduler 500 error) - Check API logs and fix
2. **Investigate Issue #1** (AGE health warning) - Review health check logic
3. **Verify Finding #3** (search behavior) - List concepts and test embedding search
4. **Test remaining commands** - Use generated concepts for search commands
5. **Document any additional fixes** - Update this report with findings
