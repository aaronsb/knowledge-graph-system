## Issues & Investigations

### Issue #1: AGE Extension Health Check Warning ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Severity:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (Informational) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed
**Command:** `kg database health`
**Status:** Database functional but reports degraded ‚Üí Now reports HEALTHY

**Root Cause:**
- Health check was using `_execute_cypher()` to execute a SQL query
- Line 175-177 in `database.py` attempted to run `SELECT extname FROM pg_extension...` as Cypher
- `_execute_cypher()` is for Cypher queries, not SQL
- This caused the AGE extension check to fail incorrectly

**Resolution:**
- Changed to use direct psycopg2 connection (like `get_database_info()` does)
- Now properly executes SQL query against PostgreSQL to check extension
- Database health now correctly shows "HEALTHY" with all checks passing

**Files Modified:**
- `src/api/routes/database.py` - Fixed AGE extension check (line 173-191)

---

### Issue #2: Scheduler Status API 500 Error ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Severity:** üî¥ High (Broken Feature) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed
**Command:** `kg admin scheduler status`
**Error:** Request failed with status code 500

**Root Cause:**
- `admin.py` line 422 called `scheduler.get_stats()` method
- Method didn't exist in `JobScheduler` class

**Resolution:**
- Implemented `get_stats()` method in `src/api/services/job_scheduler.py` (line 210)
- Returns job counts by status from job queue
- Includes placeholders for last_cleanup and next_cleanup timestamps
- Tested successfully - endpoint now returns proper status and statistics

**Files Modified:**
- `src/api/services/job_scheduler.py` - Added `get_stats()` method

---

### Finding #3: Search Returns Zero Results ‚úÖ RESOLVED (Expected Behavior)
**Severity:** üü° Informational ‚Üí ‚úÖ Working as designed
**Command:** `kg search query "human intelligence"`
**Result:** 0 concepts found with default threshold

**Investigation Results:**
1. **Actual concept label**: "Limitation of Human Intelligence" (specific/narrow)
2. **Search term**: "human intelligence" (general/broad)
3. **Similarity score**: 58.4%
4. **CLI default threshold**: 70% (0.7)

**Root Cause:**
- Threshold was too high for semantic similarity between narrow concept label and broad search term
- Additionally found bug: search endpoint wasn't passing threshold parameter to vector_search()
  - Was using hardcoded 0.85 instead of request.min_similarity

**Resolution:**
1. Fixed threshold parameter passing in `queries.py` (line 82-86)
2. Verified search works with lower threshold: `--min-similarity 0.5` returns 1 result
3. This is expected behavior - LLM extracted specific concept "Limitation of Human Intelligence"
   which has lower semantic similarity to generic "human intelligence"

**Enhancement Added - Threshold Hints:**
Implemented intelligent threshold suggestions when few results found:
- API calculates exact threshold needed to reveal additional concepts
- CLI displays helpful hint: "üí° 1 additional concept available at 56% threshold"
- Provides ready-to-run command: `kg search query "..." --min-similarity 0.56`
- Creates progressive discovery UX through the similarity gradient

**Files Modified:**
- `src/api/routes/queries.py` - Fixed threshold parameter + added threshold hint logic
- `src/api/models/queries.py` - Added `below_threshold_count` and `suggested_threshold` fields
- `client/src/types/index.ts` - Updated SearchResponse interface
- `client/src/cli/search.ts` - Added threshold hint display

## Positive Findings

### ‚úÖ 30-Type Relationship Taxonomy Fully Operational

The new relationship system from PR#24 is working perfectly:

**Evidence:**
```bash
kg database stats
```
Shows 5 distinct types from the new taxonomy:
- `CONTRASTS_WITH` (similarity category)
- `CATEGORIZED_AS` (meta category)
- `DEFINED_AS` (meta category)
- `RESULTS_FROM` (causal category)
- `USED_FOR` (functional category)

**Validation:** Zero "invalid relationship type" errors during ingestion ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Table Formatting System (ADR-019)

All list commands show clean, aligned tables:
- `kg ontology list`
- `kg jobs list`
- `kg database stats`

Formatting is consistent and professional.

### ‚úÖ Job Approval Workflow (ADR-014)

Jobs system shows detailed cost estimates and progress tracking:
- Pre-ingestion analysis with token estimates
- Real-time progress updates
- Final cost breakdown

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Scheduler Status Error
**Why:** Broken API endpoint (500 error)
**Action:** Debug `/admin/scheduler/status` endpoint
**Effort:** 30-60 minutes

### Priority 2: Investigate AGE Health Check
**Why:** Confusing "degraded" status when DB is healthy
**Action:** Review health check logic, possibly fix or remove check
**Effort:** 15-30 minutes

### Priority 3: Verify Vector Search Behavior
**Why:** Search returns 0 results unexpectedly
**Action:** List concepts, test with exact labels, check embeddings
**Effort:** 15-30 minutes

### Priority 4: Test Remaining Commands
**Why:** Complete coverage for confidence
**Action:** Ingest multi-file ontology, test all search commands
**Effort:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Issue #2** (scheduler 500 error) - Check API logs and fix
2. **Investigate Issue #1** (AGE health warning) - Review health check logic
3. **Verify Finding #3** (search behavior) - List concepts and test embedding search
4. **Test remaining commands** - Use generated concepts for search commands
5. **Document any additional fixes** - Update this report with findings
