# Technical Assessment: What Is This, Actually?

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Honest self-assessment after research review

## TL;DR

A knowledge graph system combining LLM extraction, Neo4j storage, and vector search. Uses iterative graph traversal during ingestion—graph serves as both output and active input. Each chunk queries recent concepts, feeds context to LLM, extracts new concepts, upserts to graph. Pattern inspired by coding agents that replay conversation context.

Measured results from ingestion logs: hit rate progression from 0% (chunk 1) to 62.5% (chunk 15). Graph provides growing context during ingestion, not after.

## What We Built

A knowledge graph system that:
1. Ingests documents with smart chunking
2. Extracts concepts using LLMs (GPT-4, Claude)
3. Stores them in Neo4j with vector embeddings
4. Deduplicates concepts across chunks/documents via vector similarity
5. Preserves evidence chains (quotes → concepts → sources)
6. Provides multiple query interfaces (MCP for LLMs, CLI for humans, Neo4j for visual)

**Measured from ingestion logs:**
- Document: 110,272 characters, 17 chunks, 16,617 words
- 63 concept nodes created, 28 linked to existing (31% reuse)
- 96 instance nodes (evidence quotes), 84 relationships
- Hit rate progression: 0% → 50% → 60% → 62.5%
- Checkpoint/resume: saves position every 5 chunks
- Logs location: `logs/ingest_*.log` with chunk-by-chunk statistics

## What's Novel vs What's Standard Practice

### Implementation Pattern

**Iterative Graph Traversal During Upsert**
- **Mechanism:** Graph serves as both output and active input during ingestion. Each chunk queries recent concepts → feeds to LLM → extracts new concepts → upserts to graph → next chunk uses enriched graph.
- **Measured behavior from logs:**
  - Chunk 1: 0% hit rate (empty graph, LLM in isolation)
  - Chunk 2: 50% hit rate (2 of 4 concepts matched existing)
  - Chunk 11: 60% hit rate (3 of 5 concepts matched)
  - Chunk 15: 62.5% hit rate (5 of 8 concepts matched)
  - Final: 63 new concepts, 28 reused (31% overall), 84 relationships
- **Inspiration:** Coding agents that replay conversation context as they generate code
- **Research comparison:** Microsoft GraphRAG: extraction → post-processing. LightRAG: batch-oriented dual-level retrieval. This implementation: graph participates in extraction loop in real-time.
- **Log files document complexity:** `logs/ingest_*.log` shows chunk-by-chunk vector search performance, concept matching, relationship creation, checkpoint/resume.

**2. Instance-Level Evidence Granularity**
- **What it is:** Explicit `Instance` nodes creating a three-tier evidence model: `Quote → Instance → Concept → Source`
- **Why it matters:** Full provenance chain with paragraph-level attribution
- **Research comparison:** Standard models are `Entity → Relationship → Entity`. Our model adds an evidence layer as a first-class entity.
- **Status:** More granular than typical implementations we found.

**3. Real-Time Cross-Chunk Deduplication**
- **What it is:** Vector similarity matching DURING ingestion, concepts merge as they're created. Part of the iterative traversal loop.
- **Why it matters:** Cross-document concept synthesis happens automatically during ingestion, not as post-processing. The deduplication feeds back into the graph context for subsequent chunks.
- **Research comparison:** LightRAG has incremental updates, but this real-time deduplication within the traversal loop creates tighter integration.
- **Status:** Implementation detail that compounds the value of the iterative traversal pattern.

### ✅ Standard Practice (Well-Executed)

**1. LLM-Powered Concept Extraction**
- **Status:** Everyone's doing this (EDC Framework 2024, AutoKG 2024, Microsoft GraphRAG)
- **Our approach:** Standard prompting with structured output
- **Assessment:** Not novel, but necessary foundation

**2. Neo4j + Vector Indexes**
- **Status:** Production best practice as of Neo4j 5.13+ (vector search GA)
- **Our approach:** HNSW indexes with cosine similarity
- **Assessment:** Following documented best practices

**3. Hybrid Search Capability**
- **Status:** HybridRAG paper (August 2024) establishes this as emerging standard
- **Our approach:** Vector + full-text search in Neo4j
- **Assessment:** We implemented what research validated

**4. Knowledge Graph for RAG**
- **Status:** GraphRAG identified by Gartner as "high-impact", predicted 80% adoption in data innovations by 2025
- **Our approach:** Graph storage with relationship modeling
- **Assessment:** Following the curve, not leading it
