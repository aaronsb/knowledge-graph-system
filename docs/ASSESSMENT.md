# Technical Assessment: What Is This, Actually?

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Honest self-assessment after research review

## TL;DR

This is a **synthesis** of existing techniques (LLM extraction + graph storage + vector search) with an **iterative graph traversal pattern during upsert** that we haven't found documented elsewhere. The graph serves as both output AND active input—it provides growing context AS documents are ingested, not after. Inspired by how coding agents replay conversation context as they generate code.

We're not inventing GraphRAG. We're exploring the space and trying patterns to see what works.

## What We Built

A knowledge graph system that:
1. Ingests documents with smart chunking
2. Extracts concepts using LLMs (GPT-4, Claude)
3. Stores them in Neo4j with vector embeddings
4. Deduplicates concepts across chunks/documents via vector similarity
5. Preserves evidence chains (quotes → concepts → sources)
6. Provides multiple query interfaces (MCP for LLMs, CLI for humans, Neo4j for visual)

**The goal:** Explore whether persistent knowledge graphs improve on ephemeral RAG retrieval.

## What's Novel vs What's Standard Practice

### ✨ Patterns We Haven't Found Documented Elsewhere

**1. Iterative Graph Traversal During Upsert**
- **What it is:** The graph serves as both OUTPUT and ACTIVE INPUT during ingestion. Each chunk queries recent concepts → feeds them to LLM → extracts new concepts → upserts to graph → next chunk uses the enriched graph. A self-reinforcing feedback loop.
- **The mechanism:**
  - Chunk 1: Empty graph → LLM works in isolation
  - Chunk 2: Query recent concepts → LLM has context → better relationship detection
  - Chunk 15: Dense graph → 83% hit rate → concepts automatically link across chunks
  - The graph provides growing context AS the document is ingested, not after
- **Inspiration:** Coding agents that replay entire conversation context as they generate code
- **Research comparison:** Microsoft GraphRAG does extraction → THEN post-processing. LightRAG has dual-level retrieval but extraction is batch-oriented. Neither makes the graph part of the extraction loop in real-time.
- **Status:** We haven't found this specific pattern documented. We don't yet know if it's more effective than batch approaches—observationally it seems to help with cross-chunk relationships.

**2. Instance-Level Evidence Granularity**
- **What it is:** Explicit `Instance` nodes creating a three-tier evidence model: `Quote → Instance → Concept → Source`
- **Why it matters:** Full provenance chain with paragraph-level attribution
- **Research comparison:** Standard models are `Entity → Relationship → Entity`. Our model adds an evidence layer as a first-class entity.
- **Status:** More granular than typical implementations we found.

**3. Real-Time Cross-Chunk Deduplication**
- **What it is:** Vector similarity matching DURING ingestion, concepts merge as they're created. Part of the iterative traversal loop.
- **Why it matters:** Cross-document concept synthesis happens automatically during ingestion, not as post-processing. The deduplication feeds back into the graph context for subsequent chunks.
- **Research comparison:** LightRAG has incremental updates, but this real-time deduplication within the traversal loop creates tighter integration.
- **Status:** Implementation detail that compounds the value of the iterative traversal pattern.

### ✅ Standard Practice (Well-Executed)

**1. LLM-Powered Concept Extraction**
- **Status:** Everyone's doing this (EDC Framework 2024, AutoKG 2024, Microsoft GraphRAG)
- **Our approach:** Standard prompting with structured output
- **Assessment:** Not novel, but necessary foundation

**2. Neo4j + Vector Indexes**
- **Status:** Production best practice as of Neo4j 5.13+ (vector search GA)
- **Our approach:** HNSW indexes with cosine similarity
- **Assessment:** Following documented best practices

**3. Hybrid Search Capability**
- **Status:** HybridRAG paper (August 2024) establishes this as emerging standard
- **Our approach:** Vector + full-text search in Neo4j
- **Assessment:** We implemented what research validated

**4. Knowledge Graph for RAG**
- **Status:** GraphRAG identified by Gartner as "high-impact", predicted 80% adoption in data innovations by 2025
- **Our approach:** Graph storage with relationship modeling
- **Assessment:** Following the curve, not leading it

## What We Learned Building This

**1. Iterative Graph Traversal During Upsert Shows Promise**
- Making the graph an active participant in extraction (not just the output) creates a feedback loop
- The graph provides more context with each chunk: 0% hit rate → 83% hit rate by chunk 15
- Cross-chunk relationships seem to improve because LLM sees growing context
- The feedback loop changes ingestion from linear processing to iterative knowledge building
- We don't yet know if this is more effective than batch approaches, but observationally it seems helpful

**2. Evidence Granularity Matters**
- Being able to trace back to exact quotes is valuable
- Paragraph-level attribution builds trust
- Instance nodes as first-class entities pay off

**3. Real-Time Deduplication Is Powerful**
- Concepts merging during ingestion feels natural
- Cross-document synthesis emerges organically
- Vector similarity threshold (0.85) works well in practice

**4. Hybrid Search Is Necessary**
- Vector-only misses exact matches and domain terms
- Full-text-only misses semantic relationships
- Combining them covers more ground

**5. Chunking Strategy Impacts Quality**
- Natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences) preserve meaning
- Hard cuts mid-sentence break concepts
- Context overlap helps continuity

## Conclusion

**What we've built:** A working knowledge graph system that combines existing techniques with an iterative graph traversal pattern during upsert.

**What we haven't built:** A fundamentally new paradigm or research breakthrough.

**What matters:** It works, and it explores an important question (do graphs improve RAG?) through practical experimentation.

**The main pattern:** Iterative graph traversal during upsert—making the graph both output AND active input during extraction. Inspired by how coding agents work. We haven't found this specific pattern documented elsewhere, but we don't yet know if it's more effective than batch processing. Observationally, cross-chunk relationships seem to improve as the graph provides growing context.

**Our contribution:** Not innovation. Exploration of a pattern we tried, plus documentation of what we found.

And that's okay.
