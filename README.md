# Knowledge Graph System

**Transform documents into queryable concept networks. Not retrieval - understanding.**

## What This Is

A complete knowledge graph platform that extracts concepts and relationships from any text, stores them in a production-grade graph database, and provides multiple interfaces for exploration and analysis.

**Four integrated components:**

1. **Apache AGE + PostgreSQL** - Production graph database with openCypher queries, vector search, and full RBAC
2. **FastAPI REST API** - LLM-powered extraction pipeline with job management and cost controls
3. **TypeScript CLI + MCP Server** - Unified command-line interface and Model Context Protocol server for agent integration
4. **React Visualization Explorer** - Interactive graph visualization with smart search, visual query builder, and openCypher editor

Feed it research papers, meeting notes, code commits, or philosophical texts. The system identifies concepts, understands their relationships, and preserves evidence trails back to source material. Query by meaning, not keywords. Traverse connections between ideas, not just similarity scores.

**The difference matters:** Traditional RAG retrieves text chunks that match your query. Knowledge graphs reveal how concepts *relate* - what enables what, what contradicts what, what emerges from what. The graph grows smarter with each document, automatically connecting new concepts to existing knowledge.

## Visual Overview

### Interactive Graph Visualization

Explore concept relationships through interactive force-directed graphs. Search semantically, find paths between ideas, and visualize how knowledge connects across your corpus.

*Finding paths between concepts and exploring relationship neighborhoods reveals how ideas connect across documents.*

### Multiple Query Interfaces

**Smart Search** - Semantic concept search with similarity tuning and neighborhood exploration

![Smart Search](docs/media/screenshots/smart_search.png)

**Visual Query Builder** - Drag-and-drop block-based openCypher query construction

**Direct openCypher** - Write openCypher queries directly for advanced graph traversal

### Command-Line Interface

Full-featured CLI for ingestion, querying, and system management.

### MCP Server Integration

Connect to Claude Desktop or Claude Code for agent-driven graph operations.

## How It Works

Documents flow through smart chunking that respects natural boundaries
  ‚Üì
LLM extraction identifies concepts, relationships, and evidence quotes
  ‚Üì
Graph construction in PostgreSQL with Apache AGE extension
  ‚Üì
Vector embeddings enable semantic search across concepts
  ‚Üì
Query interface reveals connections and provides provenance

**The iterative pattern:** Each chunk queries recent concepts before processing. The LLM sees what the graph already knows, enabling cross-chunk relationship detection. Early chunks populate the graph. Later chunks connect to existing concepts. Hit rates climb from 0% to 60%+ as the graph learns your domain.

**Multi-document synthesis:** Concepts automatically merge across files when semantically similar. A term mentioned in chapter 1 links to the same concept in chapter 10, even across different documents in the same ontology.

## Why This Matters

You've invested time (and API tokens) extracting knowledge from documents. Traditional systems rebuild that understanding on every query. This system *remembers*.

**Persistent concept extraction** ‚Üí Ideas become first-class entities with labels, search terms, and relationships

**Relationship modeling** ‚Üí Concepts ENABLE, SUPPORT, CONTRADICT, IMPLY each other with confidence scores

**Graph traversal** ‚Üí Explore connections between ideas across document boundaries

**Evidence provenance** ‚Üí Every concept links to source quotes with paragraph references

**Cross-ontology enrichment** ‚Üí Ingest related documents into different ontologies; shared concepts bridge them naturally

**Time as emergent property** ‚Üí Causal relationships (CAUSES, RESULTS_FROM, ENABLES) create observable time arrows without explicit timestamps

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+

```bash
# 1. Setup infrastructure
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Configure AI provider
./scripts/configure-ai.sh

# 3. Start API server
./scripts/start-api.sh
# API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
# ReDoc API: http://localhost:8000/redoc

# 4. Install TypeScript CLI
cd client && npm install && npm run build && ./install.sh && cd ..

# 5. Start visualization explorer (optional)
./scripts/start-viz.sh
# Open browser to http://localhost:3000

# 6. Ingest documents
kg ingest file document.txt --ontology "My Research"

# 7. Query concepts
kg search query "recursive patterns"
kg ontology list
kg database stats
```

**Three ways to explore your graph:**
- **CLI:** Use `kg` commands for querying and management
- **Visualization Explorer:** Open http://localhost:3000 for interactive graph exploration
- **MCP Server:** Connect via Claude Desktop/Code - See [MCP Setup Guide](docs/guides/MCP_SETUP.md)

## Live Example

After ingesting project commit history and pull requests into separate ontologies:

```bash
# Search across both ontologies
kg search query "Apache AGE migration"

# Result: "Apache AGE Migration" concept
#   - 6 evidence instances
#   - Found in: "Knowledge Graph Project History" (commits)
#   - Found in: "Knowledge Graph Project Pull Requests" (PRs)
#   - Relationships:
#       ENABLES ‚Üí RBAC Capabilities
#       PREVENTS ‚Üí Dual Database Complexity
#       RESULTS_FROM ‚Üí Unified Architecture
```

The system understood commits and PRs describe the same architectural change from different perspectives. It merged evidence, enriched relationships, and revealed the strategic narrative without explicit linking.

## When To Use This

### Core Use Cases

**ü§ñ Agent Memory System**
- Persistent memory for AI agents across sessions and conversations
- Store observations, decisions, and learned patterns as queryable concepts
- Retrieve context by semantic meaning or relationship traversal
- Build institutional knowledge that doesn't reset with each chat

**‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Intelligence**
- Add to GitHub Actions pipeline to analyze every commit and pull request
- Build rational concept understanding of architectural changes over time
- Discover what features enable what capabilities, what fixes prevent what bugs
- Create living documentation that evolves with your codebase

**üìö Research & Knowledge Work**
- Navigate philosophical texts by concept relationships, not linear reading
- Discover connections between documents you didn't know were related
- Build timelines from causal relationships (CAUSES, PRECEDES, EVOLVES_INTO)
- Synthesize insights across your entire corpus

**üíº Business & Analysis**
- Extract action items, decisions, and dependencies across meeting threads
- Track entities and relationships in financial records
- Map customer feedback to feature requests and product improvements
- Build knowledge bases that grow smarter with each document

The pattern generalizes: any text-based content can become a queryable knowledge graph with relationship-based understanding.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Apache AGE (PostgreSQL extension)** - Graph database with openCypher query support and production RBAC
- **Unified PostgreSQL architecture** - Graph data, job queue, and application state in one database
- **Job approval workflow** - Pre-ingestion cost estimates, manual or auto-approval, lifecycle management
- **Modular AI providers** - Swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, or implement custom extractors
- **Content deduplication** - SHA-256 hashing prevents reprocessing identical documents
- **Ontology management** - Group related documents; rename or delete with cascading job cleanup
- **Vector search + graph traversal** - Semantic similarity finds concepts, relationships explain connections
- **Evidence preservation** - Every concept links to source quotes with document and paragraph references
- **TypeScript client** - Unified CLI and future MCP server mode for multi-agent access
- **Dry-run capabilities** - Preview ingestion operations before committing API tokens

## What Makes This Different

Not a vector database. Not a new embedding model. A synthesis:

**LLM-powered extraction** ‚Üí Understands concepts and relationships, not just word patterns

**Graph storage** ‚Üí Models how ideas connect, not just where they appear

**Evidence-based retrieval** ‚Üí Provides source quotes with provenance, not isolated chunks

**Persistent knowledge** ‚Üí Builds understanding over time, not ephemeral query-time synthesis

**Multi-dimensional querying** ‚Üí Semantic search finds concepts, graph traversal explains relationships

**Emergent temporal structure** ‚Üí Causal relationships create observable time arrows without explicit ordering
