Intelligent Deal Management Vision
The Transformation We're Building
We're evolving from a services company that executes projects to an intelligent business that learns from every
customer interaction to create better outcomes.
Think Netflix: They don't just stream content—they use viewing data to create better shows. We're building the same
intelligence loop for professional services, using every deal, delivery, and customer success to improve our offerings
and approach continuously.
The Problem We're Solving
Today's Reality: The Custom Trap
Many of our opportunity starts from scratch. Our sales teams spend days creating custom proposals. Our delivery
teams reinvent approaches for each project. Customer insights disappear when projects end.
This creates a vicious cycle:
Longer sales cycles (custom scoping every time)
Inconsistent delivery quality (reinventing approaches)
Missed growth opportunities (insights trapped in silos)
Frustrated high-performers (administrative overhead instead of strategic work)
The Cost of Status Quo
Sales Inefficiency: 3-4 days per proposal, limiting capacity
Delivery Inconsistency: Variable quality and unpredictable margins
Lost Intelligence: Customer success insights never improve future sales
Scale Limitations: Manual processes prevent growth
Our Intelligent Business Vision
The Intelligence Loop (Core Concept)
1 Market Signals → Service Kit Evolution → Enhanced Sales → Better
Delivery → Customer Success → Market Insights
INSERT GRAPIC
Where Each Component Fits:
Deal Desk (JSM) = Market signals collection point
Service Kits (GitHub) = Standardized, evolving value propositions
AI/Automation (Rovo) = Intelligence processing and recommendation engine
GitHub-> Confluence Knowledge Base = Living service asset repository
Delivery Teams = Value realization and feedback generation
Every interaction makes us smarter:
Every deal teaches us about market needs
Every proposal tests our value proposition
Every delivery reveals what actually works
Every customer success improves future recommendations
What This Looks Like in Practice
Today
"Let me research your needs and
create a custom proposal"
Each delivery team starts from
different places
Customer feedback stays with the
project
Service offerings remain static
Tomorrow
"Based on 100+ similar
engagements, here's the proven
approach for your situation"
Delivery begins with battle-tested
playbooks and full sales context
Success patterns automatically
improve future sales and service
design
Service kits evolve based on what
actually creates customer success

Why This Matters Now
Market Reality: Professional services industry is rapidly evolving toward intelligent, outcome-based partnerships.
Clients expect faster responses, proven approaches, and continuous value creation.
Competitive Advantage: While competitors are still operating with manual processes, we're building systematic
intelligence that compounds over time.
Team Success: Our high-performers want to do strategic work, not administrative tasks. This transformation enables
them to focus on what they do best.
Business Growth: Manual processes limit scale. Intelligent automation enables predictable, profitable growth.
Next Steps
Phase 1: Foundation Building (Q3 2025)
Establish core Deal Desk workflow and first two service kits (Cloud Migration, JSM Implementation)
Goal: Establish foundation with linked systems & basic knowledge capture.
Integrate Salesforce Jira sync (opp lifecycle in Jira mirrors pipeline).
Standardize opp ticket workflow in Jira: define stages, metadata fields, and mandatory Confluence links.
Tag service kits in GitHub/Confluence/Assets
Begin artifact hygiene: ensure Confluence/Drive content is consistently linked to opp tickets.
Outcome: Every opportunity has a Jira container linking to all knowledge/artifacts.
Phase 2: Intelligence Integration (Q4 2025)
Add AI-powered recommendations and a complete service kit portfolio
Goal: Introduce intelligence + retrieval.
Enable Rovo across Jira + Confluence.
Expose Rovo to past proposals, SOWs, and service kits (via tagging/organization)
Ensure linked artifacts from Drive are accessible through Rovo
Pilot basic recommendations: similar past engagements, reusable kits
Outcome: AI-powered proposal and delivery recommendations based on past patterns.
Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Q1 2026)
Implement advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and continuous improvement automation
Goal: Adaptive, continuously improving intelligence loop.
Rovo retrieves the service kit (source of truth) and generates a contextual draft by overlaying past patterns
(industry, scope, outcomes).
Opp feedback loops (win/loss, retros, CSAT) are systematically captured and linked to Jira tickets.
Service kit owners curate updates: monthly review of service kit usage insights + delivery feedback informs
controlled updates to kits in GitHub/Confluence.
Dashboards track adoption + accuracy: recommendation effectiveness, service kit reuse rates, win rate uplift.
Outcome: A fully functioning intelligent business loop — every deal and delivery makes future engagements smarter,
faster, and more consistent.
Optional Phase 4 – Scale (2026+)
Goal: Advanced predictive intelligence.
Predict win probability based on opp attributes + historical data.
Recommend pricing/margin optimization.
Automate first-draft proposals/SOWs, leaving humans for final tailoring.
Expand loop into customer success → renewal/expansion plays powered by the same intelligence.
Implementation Philosophy (Crawl → Walk → Run)
Crawl = link systems + tag kits.
Walk = expose Rovo to curated Confluence/Drive content + opp metadata.
Run = contextual overlays + curated evolution of kits.
“Humans own the source of truth, AI accelerates application.”
Call to Action
This is bigger than process improvement—it's business evolution.
Every deal you work on, every delivery you execute, every customer interaction you have contributes to building an
intelligent business that gets better at creating value over time.
Your expertise + Our intelligence platform = Competitive advantage that compounds
"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
We're planting the seeds of an intelligent business. Every day we wait, competitors get closer to building their own
intelligence advantages. Every day we build, we get further ahead.
Let's build the future of professional services—together.
