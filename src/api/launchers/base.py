    Launchers are lightweight "sequencers" that:

    The existing job queue handles execution, progress, approval, etc.

    Three-Outcome Pattern:
    - Returns job_id: Job successfully enqueued (success)
    - Returns None: Conditions not met, skip (normal, not a failure)
    - Raises Exception: Actual failure (needs retry/backoff)
