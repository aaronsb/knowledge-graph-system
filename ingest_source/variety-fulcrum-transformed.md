# Variety as the Fulcrum: The AI Sandwich Systems Model for Human-AI Collaboration

### ©Aaron Bockelie, September 2025

## Synopsis: The Fulcrum of Transformation

A fulcrum is the pivot point that determines mechanical advantage - the position where a small force can move great weight, or where misplacement renders even great force ineffective. In the age of AI transformation, **human variety is that fulcrum**. 

Organizations are pouring billions into AI capabilities, yet 95% of enterprise AI projects fail to deliver measurable returns. The technology works - Large Language Models demonstrate unprecedented analytical power. The failure point isn't in the artificial intelligence; it's in the human intelligence that must wield it. Just as a lever's power depends entirely on fulcrum placement, AI's transformative potential depends entirely on human adaptive capacity - what cybernetics calls "variety."

This document presents the AI Sandwich Systems Model - a framework showing how all human-AI collaboration follows a fundamental pattern: Human Curation → AI Analysis → Human Decision. The "Sandwich" is a well known depiction of *Human In The Loop*, a proven method of working with machine intelligence. Through this lens, we reveal why the most sophisticated AI becomes worthless when operated by users who lack the variety to specify problems or evaluate outputs. Conversely, we show why experts often work slower with AI, spending more time verifying outputs than they would have spent doing the work directly.

The implications are profound: The bottleneck to AI transformation isn't technological but human. Organizations racing to deploy AI without first building human variety are constructing elaborate systems that amplify incompetence rather than intelligence. The winners won't be those with the best AI, but those who position the fulcrum correctly - investing in human capability as the prerequisite, not the byproduct, of AI adoption.

## Key Terms and Concepts

| **Ontology** | A structured framework for understanding a domain - the concepts, relationships, and rules that define how we interpret reality |
| **Semantic** | Relating to meaning and interpretation rather than just form or syntax - understanding what something means, not just what it says |
| **Latent** | Existing but not yet activated or visible - capabilities that are present but dormant until triggered |

## Part I: The Foundational Architecture of Human-AI Work

### The Curation-Analysis-Decision Cycle as a Universal Work Primitive

This document serves as a building primer for understanding human and machine intelligence structures. It provides a foundation for thinking about the distinct constraints common in a cybernetic work approach. The use of sandwiches and other metaphors is intentional - they serve as useful analogies to many more specific work structures.

**Core Concept - Variety:** In the context of this framework, "variety" refers to the adaptive capacity of an agent (human or AI). It is the set of possible responses, mental models, skills, and contextual understandings an agent can deploy to meet the challenges of a given problem. For a human, variety is built through experience, training, and critical thinking. For an AI, its latent variety is fixed by its training data and architecture, though we can temporarily activate specific capabilities through prompting, context, and tool access.

Before we introduce any artificial intelligence, purposeful human activity often organizes itself around a fundamental, often implicit, three-phase pattern: *Curation, Analysis, and Decision* (C-A-D). This cycle is the elemental unit of work. Cognitive science and HCI recognize similar structures as foundational to goal-oriented behavior. The C-A-D cycle is a high-level abstraction of the interaction loops that define how humans use tools to achieve objectives.

Let's visualize this fundamental pattern as a "sandwich" - a simple metaphor that will become powerful as we build complexity:

  <text x="200" y="177" text-anchor="middle" font-family="Arial, sans-serif" font-size="10" fill="#666">Commit to Action</text>
</svg>
</div>

In this pure "human" workflow:
- **Curation** involves understanding context, gathering requirements, defining scope
- **Analysis** involves processing information, applying expertise, transforming inputs
- **Decision** involves evaluating outputs, considering implications, committing to outcomes

The **Curation** phase - scoping and defining a problem - corresponds directly to the initial stages of cognitive task analysis, where an individual forms an intention and translates it into actionable requirements. This involves understanding the broader context, gathering necessary information, and establishing task boundaries. HCI research emphasizes this initial step as critical for bridging the gap between a person's abstract goal and the concrete actions a system can perform.[^1]

The **Analysis** phase - processing and transforming information - represents the core execution of the task, where expertise is applied to convert inputs into outputs.

The **Decision** phase - integrating results and committing to action - mirrors the evaluation stage in HCI models. In this final step, users assess the system's output against their original intention, consider its implications, and determine the next course of action.[^2]

This C-A-D pattern is an observable primitive in virtually all structured work:
- In agile software development: Backlog Refinement (Curation), Development (Analysis), and Acceptance/Deployment (Decision)
- In strategic planning: Market Assessment (Curation), Scenario Modeling (Analysis), and Strategic Choice (Decision)
- In medical diagnosis: Patient History & Examination (Curation), Diagnostic Testing & Interpretation (Analysis), and Treatment Planning (Decision) 
- In investment analysis: Due Diligence (Curation), Valuation & Risk Modeling (Analysis), and Portfolio Allocation (Decision)
- In law practice: Discovery & Case Scoping (Curation), Precedent Analysis & Argumentation (Analysis), Settlement or Trial Strategy (Decision)

This cycle as the "fundamental unit of work" correctly abstracts a universal pattern of human cognition and purposeful action. The interaction paradigms described in HCI research - intermittent, continuous, and proactive interactions - all contextualize within this framework. The C-A-D cycle represents the elemental structure of a deliberate, "intermittent" engagement with a task or system.[^3]

### The "AI Sandwich" as a Dominant Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Paradigm

Our first transformation of the fundamental work unit introduces AI into the Analysis phase, creating the "AI Sandwich": a Human Curation layer, followed by an AI Analysis layer, and concluding with a Human Decision layer.

</svg>
</div>

This creates our first "AI Sandwich" - Human-AI-Human collaboration where:
- Humans define what needs to be done
- AI performs the analysis at speed and scale
- Humans evaluate results and make final decisions

**Why this pattern?** Because it leverages the complementary strengths:
- Humans excel at context, judgment, and responsibility
- AI excels at pattern recognition, computation, and consistency

This Human-AI-Human (H-A-H) architecture represents one of the most widely recognized and implemented paradigms in Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) machine learning. Its prevalence directly results from its effectiveness in leveraging the complementary strengths of human and artificial intelligence while mitigating the inherent weaknesses of each.

HITL is formally defined as a collaborative approach that integrates human expertise into the lifecycle of AI systems, with humans actively participating in the training, evaluation, or operation of the models.[^4] This participation is most critical at the interfaces of the system with the real world. The AI Sandwich perfectly captures this best practice:

- The initial "Human Curation" layer corresponds to the HITL stages of data annotation, labeling, and problem formulation, where human contextual understanding is essential to provide the AI with a well-defined task.[^5]
- The final "Human Decision" layer aligns with the HITL stages of evaluation, validation, and oversight, where human judgment is required to interpret the AI's output, assess its real-world implications, and assume accountability for the final action.[^6]

This structure is advocated across a vast body of research and practice. Stanford's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) initiative explicitly reframes automation challenges as HCI design problems, promoting systems where humans provide initial guidance and make final judgments on outputs.[^6] This approach enhances accuracy, mitigates bias, and increases user trust.[^4] 

Modern AI agentic frameworks provide technical instantiations of this pattern. Systems like LangGraph and CrewAI are designed to build structured workflows that can be explicitly paused to await human input or approval before proceeding, formalizing the decision layer of the sandwich.[^8] For instance, LangGraph's interrupt() function directly implements the checkpoint between AI Analysis and Human Decision.

The AI Sandwich is therefore not just a metaphor but a robust architectural pattern. It's the default configuration for responsible AI implementation in high-stakes domains like marketing, product development, and software engineering, where a human must vet AI-generated content or code before deployment.[^7]

This H-A-H structure is more than a method for leveraging complementary strengths; it's a fundamental pattern for managing the inherent risks of automation. The architecture strategically places human oversight at the two points of highest ambiguity and consequence: problem formulation (Curation) and commitment to action (Decision). The AI is effectively quarantined in the "safest" part of the process - the well-defined, bounded transformation of inputs to outputs.

An error in the Curation phase - misspecifying the problem or using biased data - leads to the AI solving the wrong problem perfectly, a high-risk outcome. Similarly, an error in the Decision phase - uncritically accepting a flawed or unethical AI recommendation - can lead to direct, tangible harm. The Analysis phase, in contrast, is a more deterministic transformation; if the inputs and the algorithm are sound, the output is largely predictable. It's the phase with the lowest contextual ambiguity.

The AI Sandwich functions as an intuitive yet powerful risk management framework that confines the non-contextual, probabilistic AI to the lowest-risk segment of the workflow, while ensuring that accountable human intelligence remains in control at the high-risk interfaces with the real world.

### A Cybernetic Interpretation of System Dimensions: Scope and Time

Each layer of the sandwich has two primary dimensions: Time (vertical height) and Scope (horizontal width). These dimensions provide a useful heuristic for understanding the functional role of each phase and are consistent with principles of systems theory and organizational design.

The **Time** dimension, representing the duration of each phase, captures the primary economic driver for adopting the AI Sandwich pattern. Human analysis is typically slower and more resource-intensive, while AI analysis is orders of magnitude faster. This substitution of AI for human analysis often provides the principal justification for an AI initiative, promising significant productivity gains by compressing the central phase of the work cycle.[^7]

The **Scope** dimension is more conceptually nuanced and critically important. The "wide-narrow-wide" pattern for scope describes a fundamental process of contextual expansion, focused transformation, and contextual reintegration.

</div>

- **Wide Curation:** The initial Curation phase must have the broadest scope. To define a problem effectively, the human curator must understand the full business context, strategic objectives, potential downstream implications, ethical guardrails, and user needs. This aligns with foundational HCI principles, which mandate a deep and broad understanding of the user and their environment before any system design begins.[^9] A failure to establish a sufficiently wide scope at this stage is a primary cause of AI project failure, as the system may be optimized for a problem that is irrelevant or even counterproductive in the larger organizational context.

- **Narrow Analysis:** The AI Analysis phase is, by design, the narrowest. It performs a specific, well-defined transformation on a given set of inputs. Its world is bounded by the data it receives and the algorithm it executes. This narrow focus enables its speed and consistency, but it's also the source of its brittleness. The AI has no awareness of the broader context from which its inputs came or the context into which its outputs will be placed.

- **Wide Decision:** The final Human Decision phase must broaden the scope once more. The human decider cannot simply evaluate the output for technical correctness. They must integrate the result back into the wider strategic context, assessing its business implications, ethical consequences, and potential impact on other systems or stakeholders. This act of contextual reintegration is a hallmark of responsible AI deployment and is essential for ensuring that a locally optimal solution doesn't create a globally suboptimal or harmful outcome.[^5]

The "wide-narrow-wide" scope dynamic is therefore a crucial insight. It illustrates that the value of AI is not realized in the narrow analysis phase alone, but in the ability of the surrounding human layers to manage the transitions between broad contextual understanding and focused computational execution.

### Scaling Through Chains: The Sprint Pattern

Single sandwiches rarely exist in isolation. In real work, we chain them together:

This chaining pattern appears everywhere:
- **Agile sprints**: Multiple user stories completed in sequence
- **Manufacturing pipelines**: Sequential processing stages
- **Content workflows**: Draft → Review → Edit → Publish

Each sandwich in the chain maintains the same three-phase structure, but the output of one becomes the context for the next.

### Extended Autonomy: Multiple AI Cycles

As trust in AI systems grows, organizations attempt longer autonomous chains:

Here, humans only bookend extended AI operations. This is how tools like Claude Code or autonomous agents operate - multiple AI-driven cycles between human touchpoints.

### Recursive Depth: Sandwiches Within Sandwiches

The model's true complexity emerges when we recognize that each layer can contain its own sandwich structure:

This recursion appears naturally:
- A human curation phase might internally use AI to search documents
- An AI analysis might spawn sub-analyses for different data types
- A decision phase might involve multiple evaluation cycles

**Critical insight**: Recursive depth and sequential length present identical challenges. Ten nested AI operations carry the same risks as ten sequential operations, but recursion hides its complexity.

### Activating Latent Variety: The Hidden Potential

Both humans and AI possess vast untapped potential beyond what's immediately visible. This latent variety exists as:
- **Dormant Capabilities**: Skills and knowledge that exist but aren't currently activated
- **Alternative Frameworks**: Different mental models or approaches that could be applied to the same problem
- **Domain Transfer**: Expertise from adjacent fields that could provide novel solutions

For example, when a developer approaches a data processing problem, they simultaneously possess knowledge of multiple programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented, procedural), various algorithms, and design patterns. The choice of which variety to activate - which "ontological thread" to follow - determines the solution path. Similarly, an AI model trained on diverse data contains multiple potential approaches to any given problem. The art lies in activating the right variety through effective prompting, context provision, and tool selection.

## Part II: The Governing Dynamics of Scaled and Complex Systems

When we scale beyond the single unit of work, the true explanatory power emerges in analyzing scaled and complex systems. Here we ground our central thesis - the "Capability Matching Principle" - in one of the foundational laws of cybernetics: Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety. This connection elevates our framework from descriptive to predictive and diagnostic, explaining the fundamental constraints that govern the effectiveness of any human-AI system.

### The Capability Matching Principle and Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety

The Capability Matching Principle states that the system managing a problem must have at least as many ways to respond as the problem has ways to manifest. The overall system's capability is limited by the minimum capability of its human Curation and Decision layers:

```
System Capability ≤ min(Human_Curation_Capability, Human_Decision_Capability)
```

This principle is a direct and precise application of W. Ross Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety, often called "the first law of cybernetics".[^10]

Ashby's Law states that for a system to be stable, the number of states its control mechanism is capable of attaining (its variety) must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled.[^12] In simpler terms, to effectively regulate a system, the regulator must be at least as complex as the system it seeks to control.[^10] 

The classic analogy: a thermostat regulating room temperature. If the room's temperature can fluctuate in many ways (due to sun, open windows, number of people), a thermostat that can only turn the heat on or off once a day lacks the "requisite variety" to maintain a stable temperature. It cannot respond to the variety of disturbances in its environment.[^11]

In the AI Sandwich, the human at the Curation and Decision layers acts as the **regulator** or **controller**. The problem space and the AI's potential solution space constitute the **system being regulated**.

- **At the Curation Layer:** The human curator must possess sufficient variety (domain knowledge, contextual understanding, ability to ask nuanced questions) to adequately specify the problem for the AI. If a junior developer (a low-variety regulator) can only conceive of simple functions, they cannot effectively task a high-variety AI capable of generating complex architectures. The AI's potential is constrained by the developer's inability to articulate a problem that would leverage it. The variety of the controller is less than the variety of the situation.

- **At the Decision Layer:** The human decider must have enough variety (expertise, critical judgment, awareness of implications) to evaluate the AI's output. If a manager receives a comprehensive market analysis from an AI but lacks the variety to validate its assumptions, identify its gaps, or question its conclusions, the AI's sophisticated output is rendered useless or, worse, dangerously misleading. The system's effectiveness collapses to the level of the human's ability to regulate the information it produces.

Ashby's Law provides a formal, mathematical foundation for our central claim. The formula:

```
Variety(Controller) ≥ Variety(Situation)
```

[^13] directly maps to our assertion that the AI's capabilities become irrelevant when bounded by human limitations. The sandwich can only be as sophisticated as its bread. 

This cybernetic principle explains why simply deploying a more powerful AI model often fails to produce better results. If the variety of the human interfaces doesn't increase in parallel, the additional capability of the AI remains inaccessible and untapped. The bottleneck is not the technology; it's the regulatory capacity of the humans in the loop.

### The Variety Problem in Practice

Let's see how capability constraints manifest in concrete scenarios:

#### Example: Code Generation
- **Junior developer** (low variety): Can only request simple functions, cannot evaluate complex outputs
- **AI system** (high potential variety): Can generate sophisticated architectures
- **Result**: System output limited to junior developer's comprehension level

The AI's sophistication is wasted because the human cannot:
1. Specify problems beyond their understanding
2. Evaluate solutions outside their expertise
3. Detect accumulating technical debt

#### Example: Business Analysis
- **Manager** (low variety): Requests competitive analysis with vague parameters
- **AI system** (high potential variety): Can perform multi-dimensional market analysis with Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, value chain analysis, and game theory modeling
- **Result**: Delivers basic SWOT because manager's prompt lacks specificity

The AI's sophistication is wasted because the human cannot:
1. Articulate which analytical frameworks are most relevant to their strategic situation
2. Identify missing competitive factors or flawed assumptions in the analysis
3. Recognize when the AI has omitted critical market dynamics or regulatory constraints
- **Result**: Decisions based on unverified, potentially incomplete AI outputs

### How AI Systems Acquire Variety

Humans gain variety through experience - each interaction potentially adds capability. But AI systems face a fundamental limitation: **AI models are frozen between training cycles**. They cannot learn from individual interactions.

Instead, we temporarily grant AI systems variety through at least five specific methods:

1. **Prompting** - Explicit instructions that activate specific capabilities
2. **Context Windows** - Relevant examples that guide processing
3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Dynamic knowledge injection
4. **Tool Access (MCP Servers)** - Functional variety through external capabilities
5. **Chain-of-Thought** - Step-by-step reasoning patterns

**Critical insight**: These methods don't add capabilities to AI; they activate latent variety that already exists in the model. The effectiveness is bounded by the human's ability to specify what variety to activate.

### Variety Mismatch Failure Modes

The AI Sandwich's effectiveness depends on variety matching at each layer. When variety mismatches occur, specific failure modes emerge:

### Compounding Risk in Sequential and Recursive Structures

The risks inherent in a single AI sandwich amplify when these units are chained together sequentially or nested recursively. Recursive depth and sequential length present identical challenges - a profound insight into the nature of systemic risk in these architectures. The primary mechanism for this risk amplification is the accumulation and compounding of "drift" and "hidden technical debt."

Each step in an AI-driven chain introduces potential for small errors or deviations from the original intent. An AI model's output is probabilistic, not deterministic, and may contain subtle inaccuracies, biases from its training data, or "hallucinations." When the output of one AI process becomes the input for the next, these small errors don't simply add up; they can compound exponentially. 

This phenomenon is validated by the concept of "Entanglement" in machine learning systems, where the "Changing Anything Changes Everything" (CACE) principle highlights how interconnected components can cause minor tweaks to have unexpected, rippling effects throughout the system.[^15] A slight misinterpretation in step one can lead to a significant deviation by step ten.

This compounding drift is a form of "hidden technical debt." In software engineering, technical debt is the implied future cost of choosing an easy or fast solution now instead of a more robust one later.[^16] AI-generated code or content is a prime source of this debt. When a low-variety user accepts an AI's output without the capacity for deep scrutiny, they're incurring debt. The code may function, but it might contain hidden security vulnerabilities, inefficient algorithms, or "black-box" logic that will be difficult to maintain or debug in the future.[^17] 

In a long chain of AI operations without adequate human oversight, this debt accumulates at each step, creating a system that's increasingly fragile, unpredictable, and costly to maintain.[^17]

Recursion hides this complexity particularly well. A sequential chain of ten AI steps is visibly complex, signaling a need for caution. A recursive function that calls itself ten times performs the same number of operations, but its complexity is hidden within a deceptively simple structure. This is dangerous in traditional software but exponentially more so with AI. Because each recursive call can introduce probabilistic drift, the final output can diverge wildly from the initial intent in ways that are nearly impossible to trace or debug. The risk profile of ten nested AI operations is identical to that of ten sequential ones, but the perceived risk is far lower, making recursion a particularly insidious source of compounding failure.

### The Irreversibility of Experience: The Human-AI Learning Asymmetry

A cornerstone principle: every human-AI interaction is an opportunity for the human to increase their variety (learn), while the AI's core capabilities remain unchanged. This creates a widening gap in capability over time. This assertion is strongly supported by the fundamental technical realities of how most contemporary AI models are trained and deployed.

The vast majority of large-scale AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are trained using **Batch Learning** (or Offline Learning).[^18] In this paradigm, the model is trained on a massive, static dataset in a computationally intensive process that can take weeks or months. Once this training is complete, the model's weights are frozen. It's then deployed as a static asset. 

When a user interacts with this model, it can use the context of the conversation (e.g., the prompt and prior turns) to generate a relevant response, but this context is transient. It doesn't permanently alter the model's underlying knowledge or capabilities. After the session ends, the "learning" that occurred within that context vanishes.[^18] The model cannot learn from individual interactions in a persistent way; it only gains new capabilities when its creators decide to retrain it on a new dataset, a process that happens infrequently.

Human learning, in stark contrast, is continuous and experiential. Every interaction - every success, every failure, every surprising AI output - has the potential to be integrated into a human's long-term memory, refining their mental models and permanently increasing their variety.[^19] A developer who struggles to debug a piece of AI-generated code doesn't just fix the bug; they learn about a new failure mode, a new pattern to watch for, and a new way to structure their prompts. This learning is cumulative and irreversible. While AI can simulate learning within a session, humans achieve genuine, persistent learning across sessions.

This fundamental asymmetry has profound implications. It confirms that prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and other techniques don't add new capability to the AI; they're merely sophisticated methods for activating the **latent variety** that already exists within the frozen model. The effectiveness of these activation techniques is, once again, bounded by the human's ability to specify what is needed.

The quality and precision of the AI's output are directly proportional to the variety of the human's input. An AI model is a passive repository of immense potential knowledge. Human variety is the active catalyst required to unlock and shape that potential. 

For example, a junior marketer might ask an LLM, "Write a marketing plan." The AI, receiving a low-variety prompt, will activate a generic, boilerplate subset of its latent knowledge, producing a low-variety output. A Chief Marketing Officer, however, might ask, "Develop a go-to-market strategy for a D2C sustainable sneaker targeting Gen Z urbanites, focusing on a TikTok-first influencer campaign with a budget of $50k. Emphasize authenticity and community-building over direct sales language. Provide KPIs for engagement, not just conversion." This high-variety prompt activates a far more specific, nuanced, and valuable slice of the AI's latent knowledge, resulting in a high-variety output. The AI's *effective* variety in any given interaction is therefore not its theoretical maximum but the subset that the human's own variety can successfully elicit.

This learning asymmetry creates a dangerous organizational dynamic over time. As a human user interacts with a static AI tool, their own expertise and variety grow. Their needs become more sophisticated, and they begin to notice the AI's limitations, its repetitive outputs, and its subtle flaws. The static AI, unable to learn and grow alongside the user, can no longer meet their evolving demands. This leads to expert abandonment of the tool, as the cognitive overhead of correcting or working around the AI's deficiencies becomes greater than the benefit it provides. Consequently, the tool's primary user base trends toward a perpetual stream of novices, who are least equipped to detect its errors. This creates a systemic condition where the organization's AI tools are predominantly used by those who maximize the injection of hidden technical debt, turning a tool intended for productivity into a hidden engine of risk.

## Part III: The Socio-Technical Expression of Variety Mismatch

The abstract principles of cybernetics and systems dynamics find their tangible expression in the observable, real-world behaviors of individuals and organizations. Here we connect the governing dynamics of variety mismatch to the socio-technical phenomena: the "Expertise Paradox," the "magic" of turnkey systems, and the crucial role of "Productive Doubt." We use empirical research on user behavior and learning science to validate these concepts, demonstrating how the abstract law of requisite variety manifests as concrete organizational challenges and opportunities.

### Empirical Evidence for the Expertise Paradox and the Adoption Valley

The "Adoption Valley" graphically illustrates a fundamental paradox in AI adoption:

Those who need AI the most (low-variety users) are least able to use it effectively, while those who could use it most effectively (high-variety users) often choose not to due to high overhead costs. This creates a narrow threshold of users for whom the benefit marginally outweighs the cost. This phenomenon is strongly supported by empirical research into how users with different levels of expertise interact with AI tools.

Studies comparing the performance of novices and experts provide direct validation for the struggles of low-variety users. Research on data work for conversational agents found that while novice crowd workers could perform simple classification tasks as well as experts, the experts produced significantly higher quality, novelty, and emotional appropriateness on more complex "generative tasks," such as authoring new lines of dialogue.[^20] These generative tasks are analogous to the Curation and Decision layers of the AI sandwich, which require a high degree of creativity, context, and nuanced judgment. Novices, lacking this variety, are unable to effectively guide or evaluate the AI in these critical phases. This leads to a situation where their reliance on AI can actively diminish their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as they offload cognitive effort without engaging in the deep processing that builds expertise.[^23]

Conversely, high-variety users may avoid AI tools - a phenomenon powerfully substantiated by research on expert productivity. A landmark randomized controlled trial found that experienced open-source software developers took **19% longer** to complete tasks when using AI coding assistants.[^26] This striking result reveals the hidden "tax" of verification and correction that experts must pay. While the AI can generate code quickly, a high-variety expert must invest significant cognitive effort to scrutinize that code for architectural soundness, adherence to best practices, subtle bugs, and hidden security flaws - a process that can be more time-consuming than writing the code correctly from the outset. 

The same study noted a dangerous disconnect between perception and reality: even while being slowed down, the developers *believed* the AI had made them 20% faster.[^26] This captures the expert's dilemma perfectly: the perceived benefit of rapid generation is often outweighed by the actual cost of rigorous validation. The same studies that highlighted experts' superior performance also noted that they found the AI-mediated tasks to be "tedious and repetitive," further explaining their reluctance to engage with tools that don't match their level of sophistication and workflow.[^21]

This avoidance by experts is not arrogance or resistance to change, but a rational calculation of cognitive cost. An expert weighs the total effort of the AI-assisted workflow - (1) meticulously translating their tacit knowledge into an explicit prompt, (2) waiting for the AI to generate a response, (3) deeply verifying the output for correctness and nuance, and (4) integrating and refactoring the output - against the effort of simply performing the task directly. For complex, non-trivial tasks, the cognitive overhead introduced by the AI workflow (steps 1, 3, and 4) often exceeds the time saved by automated generation (step 2). For the expert, the AI tool is not a cognitive-load-saver but a cognitive-load-adder. This rational optimization to minimize cognitive friction explains their position in the Adoption Valley.

| **Primary AI Use Case**             | Task completion, scaffolding for learning, overcoming knowledge gaps.                                                                                                     | Idea generation, automating boilerplate tasks, exploring alternative approaches.                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Dominant Risk**                   | The uncritical acceptance of "confidently wrong" AI outputs, leading to the propagation of errors and biases throughout the organization.[^28]                            | Rational avoidance of the tool for complex tasks due to high cognitive overhead, leading to a user base that is disproportionately composed of novices, which in turn amplifies the dominant risk of the novice user.                    |

### The Illusion of Capability: Pre-Packaged Variety in Turnkey Systems

The "Magic Gradient" explains the subjective user experience with sophisticated, turnkey AI platforms. Sophisticated AI platforms carry **embedded variety** from their creators - years of expertise crystallized into the system. This creates an interesting phenomenon:

#### The Magic Gradient
- **Low-variety users** experience these systems as "magical" - the embedded variety far exceeds their own
- **High-variety users** see through to the mechanisms - recognizing the algorithms and orchestration underneath

**Example 1: Conversational AI Agent's Search**
- A novice sees inexplicable intelligence
- An expert recognizes keyword extraction, vector similarity, and ranking algorithms

**Example 2: Enterprise Knowledge Graph AI**
A major collaboration platform calls their system both an "AI agent" and "search" - revealing its dual nature. It uses a graph approach to connect all organizational data:
- **Low-variety users** are amazed when it automatically traverses the graph, finding connected tickets, documentation pages, and team conversations they didn't know existed, synthesizing answers from across the organization
- **High-variety users** may be unimpressed - they already know the optimal search terms, understand the graph relationships, and critically, they know about valuable data contexts that exist outside the system's graph that cannot be easily added to its consideration

**Example 3: "Engineering-to-Finance" AI Platform**
A platform promises to "connect code to cash" through AI agents that bridge engineering and finance:
- **Low-variety users** see magical ROI calculations appearing from their code commits, automated customer feedback loops, and "30-40% velocity improvements" - the AI agents seem to understand both code and business value simultaneously
- **High-variety users** recognize standard Git analytics, basic issue tracking correlations, and customer usage telemetry wrapped in business intelligence dashboards - they understand the "AI agents" are rule-based workflows correlating existing data points that were always available but previously required manual analysis

**Example 4: Enterprise "Work AI" Platform**
A $7 billion enterprise search unicorn promises AI agents that "think, reflect, and act autonomously" across 100+ integrated tools:
- **Low-variety users** are mesmerized when agents "understand" their role and automatically execute multi-step workflows, iterate until conditions are met, and surface insights from both internal data and real-time internet sources - it appears the AI truly comprehends their work context
- **High-variety users** recognize semantic search with role-based filtering, pre-configured API integrations, template-based workflow automation, and permission-aware data federation - they understand the "agentic reasoning" is conditional branching based on keywords and the "understanding" is access control lists combined with usage analytics

**Example 5: "Autonomous Cloud Operations" Platform**
A platform promises "zero human intervention" cloud management with ML-driven optimization:
- **Low-variety users** marvel at "autonomous" operations that achieve "25-30% cost reduction" and "75% decrease in incidents" - the platform seems to understand infrastructure needs better than human operators, predicting and preventing problems before they occur
- **High-variety users** recognize auto-scaling rules based on historical patterns, cost optimization through scheduled instance rightsizing, threshold-based alerting with automated runbook execution, and "predictive" management that's really statistical analysis of time-series metrics - capabilities that cloud providers already offer natively but require manual configuration

The same tool creates opposite reactions: magic for those who don't understand graph traversal and context aggregation, frustration for those who see its boundaries.

A high-variety user, in contrast, possesses a more complete mental model of the system.[^9] An expert data scientist or information architect understands the principles of graph traversal, vector similarity, and context aggregation. They see these platforms not as magical agents but as efficient implementations of known techniques. More importantly, their high variety allows them to immediately perceive the system's boundaries and limitations. They are acutely aware of valuable organizational knowledge that exists outside the system's graph - in informal conversations, in legacy systems, in tacit expertise - and they know the system cannot access this critical context.

This creates opposite reactions to the same tool. For the novice, it's a revelation; for the expert, it's a frustration. The expert sees not what the system does, but what it doesn't do - and more critically, what it *can't* do without significant re-architecture. This perception gap has profound strategic implications. Organizations often mistake the enthusiasm of their low-variety users as validation of a tool's effectiveness, while the skepticism of their high-variety users is dismissed as resistance to change. In reality, the experts' reservations are often the most accurate assessment of the tool's true limitations and the hidden costs of its deployment.

The danger lies in organizational dependency on pre-packaged variety without understanding. When an organization relies on a turnkey system's embedded variety without cultivating internal understanding, it creates a fragile dependency. The organization can use the tool but cannot adapt, extend, or debug it when it fails. This is the trap of borrowed variety - it provides temporary capability without building permanent competence.

**A rational assessment**: These examples should not be interpreted as criticisms of these platforms. From a rational, unbiased perspective, they represent legitimate and valuable solutions to real business problems. The "magic" that low-variety users experience is not deception - it's effective abstraction. These platforms successfully democratize capabilities that would otherwise require significant expertise to implement. 

The key insight is not that these tools are problematic, but rather that they create different value propositions across the variety spectrum:
- For **low-variety users**, they provide immediate access to sophisticated capabilities that would otherwise be completely inaccessible
- For **medium-variety users**, they offer productivity gains by automating routine tasks while preserving flexibility
- For **high-variety users**, the value proposition may be less compelling due to overhead costs, but this doesn't negate the platform's utility for others

The strategic imperative is not to avoid these tools but to consciously manage their deployment across the variety spectrum. Organizations must recognize that the same platform will be perceived and utilized differently by users of different variety levels, and plan accordingly. This includes providing appropriate training for low-variety users to gradually increase their capabilities, while potentially offering more direct access or bypass options for high-variety users who find the abstraction layers constraining.

Success lies not in universal adoption but in variety-appropriate deployment - matching tools to users in ways that maximize value while building long-term organizational capability.

### The Power of Productive Doubt: Building Variety Through Cognitive Friction

Productive doubt - the uncomfortable recognition that one's current variety is insufficient - emerges as a critical mechanism for variety growth. This concept, grounded in learning science's "desirable difficulties"[^30] and organizational psychology's "double-loop learning,"[^34] reveals that the very friction organizations seek to eliminate may be essential for building human capability.

Desirable difficulties are challenges that make learning harder in the short term but improve long-term retention and transfer.[^31] These include spacing practice over time, varying practice contexts, and forcing learners to generate answers rather than simply recognizing them.[^32] In the context of AI adoption, desirable difficulties manifest as:

- **The struggle to formulate effective prompts** - forcing users to articulate their thinking clearly
- **The effort to evaluate AI outputs critically** - building judgment and domain expertise
- **The challenge of debugging AI-generated solutions** - developing deep understanding of underlying systems
- **The friction of peer review and collaboration** - exposing users to alternative approaches and higher variety

Organizations that eliminate all these frictions in the name of "democratizing AI" actually prevent variety growth. Consider the following contrasts:

**Without Productive Doubt:**
- Instant AI answers → No struggle → No deep understanding
- No code reviews → No exposure to better practices
- Removed gatekeepers → No variety checkpoints
- Frictionless workflows → No skill development

**With Productive Doubt:**
- Challenging problems → Effortful processing → Deep learning
- Mandatory peer review → Exposure to higher variety
- Expert gatekeepers → Variety scaffolding
- Strategic friction → Continuous capability growth

The neuroscience of learning supports this principle. The brain prioritizes information that requires effort to acquire, creating stronger neural pathways for knowledge gained through struggle.[^33] This is why experts who learned through years of challenging experience possess robust mental models that can detect subtle errors, while novices who learned through AI assistance have fragile understanding that crumbles under pressure.

Productive doubt also serves as a critical signal for organizational learning. When users frequently doubt AI outputs, it indicates either:
1. The AI lacks sufficient variety for the task (system limitation)
2. The users lack sufficient variety to properly utilize the AI (human limitation)
3. Both conditions exist simultaneously (systemic mismatch)

Each type of doubt requires different interventions, but all are valuable diagnostic signals that should be amplified, not suppressed.

## Part IV: Case Studies and Empirical Validation

### How Variety Constraints Explain High-Profile AI Failures

Every major AI failure can be traced to a violation of the requisite variety principle at one or more layers of the sandwich. These aren't stories of bad algorithms but of misaligned systems where human variety was insufficient to regulate AI capability. Let's examine how variety mismatch manifests in real-world failures:

**Table 2: Mapping AI Failure Case Studies to the Variety Constraints Model**

| Case Study                        | Apparent Failure                 | Sandwich Layer of Failure | Root Cause (Variety Mismatch Diagnosis)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Key Takeaway                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon Hiring Tool**[^38]       | Gender Bias                      | **Curation**              | The variety of the training data (historically male-dominated resumes) was less than the variety of the desired outcome (a diverse pool of qualified candidates). The human curators failed to provide the system with a model of the world that had requisite variety. | An AI system will faithfully and precisely amplify the variety (or lack thereof) of its human curators.                                                                 |
| **Microsoft Tay Chatbot**[^38]    | Racist & Offensive Outputs       | **Decision**              | The system lacked a human decision layer with the requisite variety to regulate outputs in a complex, adversarial social environment. The AI decision-maker's variety was insufficient to counter the variety of malicious user inputs.                                 | A system without a final regulatory checkpoint that matches the complexity of its operational environment is guaranteed to fail.                                        |
| **Apple Card Credit Limits**[^39] | Discriminatory Credit Decisions  | **Analysis & Decision**   | The "black box" nature of the analysis layer prevented human oversight, a deficit in regulatory variety. The human decision to deploy an unauditable system represented a failure to ensure requisite variety in the overall governance process.                        | Opaque systems are, by definition, systems that cannot be effectively regulated. Trusting them is an abdication of responsibility.                                      |
| **IBM Watson for Oncology**[^28]  | Unsafe Treatment Recommendations | **Curation & Decision**   | Curation failed by using a small set of hypothetical, low-variety data instead of real-world patient data. The Decision layer (oncologists) functioned correctly: their high variety allowed them to detect the system's flaws and reject its low-quality outputs.      | When a high-variety human regulator encounters a low-variety system, the correct outcome is rejection of the system's output. The failure would have been accepting it. |

### The Deception of Vanity Metrics: Measuring Adoption vs. Variety-Matched Utilization

A direct consequence of failing to understand the principle of requisite variety is that organizations systematically measure the wrong things. The most common metric for the success of an internal AI initiative is the "adoption rate" - the number of employees actively using the tool. This is a dangerously misleading, and potentially inverse, indicator of true value creation.

Research into AI transformation failures highlights a stark reality: human factors, not technical limitations, account for the vast majority of challenges.[^40] User proficiency emerges as the single largest failure point, dramatically outpacing technical or data quality issues.[^40] Yet, a simple adoption metric makes no distinction between a novice user uncritically copying and pasting flawed AI output and an expert user leveraging the tool for sophisticated, validated work. It treats all usage as equal, ignoring the critical factor of variety.

Effective AI adoption is not defined by the volume of deployments but by the sustained, responsible delivery of business value.[^42] High adoption by a low-variety user base is not a sign of success; it's a leading indicator of accumulating hidden technical debt, propagating unverified information, and increasing organizational risk. Each instance of a novice accepting a "confidently wrong" AI output[^29] increments the adoption metric while decrementing the organization's overall health.

A variety-centric approach demands a shift in measurement. Instead of tracking raw adoption, organizations should focus on **variety-matched utilization**:

- **Success Metrics for Low-Variety Users:** For novices, success should not be measured by output volume, but by learning and skill development. Are they using the AI as a scaffold? Is their proficiency (and thus, their variety) increasing over time? Are they participating in review processes that build their critical evaluation skills?

- **Success Metrics for High-Variety Users:** For experts, success is measured by the tangible business value they create. Are they using AI to automate low-variety tasks, freeing up their time for high-impact work? Are they able to leverage AI for novel exploration and innovation? Are they identifying high-impact use cases that deliver a clear return on investment?[^43]

By focusing on adoption, organizations chase a vanity metric that masks deep systemic problems. By shifting focus to variety-matched utilization and tangible business value, they can begin to manage their AI ecosystems for long-term health and sustainable performance.

### Why AI Transformations Fail: The Cascading Failure Pattern

With our complete model, we can now understand why so many AI initiatives disappoint. The failure follows a predictable cascade:

#### The Cascading Failure Pattern

1. Organization recognizes AI potential
2. Invests millions in licenses and platforms
3. Deploys to all staff for "democratization"
4. Low-variety majority cannot utilize effectively
5. High-variety minority avoids due to overhead
6. Metrics show high adoption, low value
7. Confusion about why transformation failed

#### The Fundamental Mistakes

1. **Assuming AI adds capability rather than being bounded by human variety**
   - Organizations deploy AI to low-variety users
   - System capability collapses to human limitations
   - No amount of AI sophistication can overcome this

2. **Measuring adoption instead of effective utilization**
   - High usage by low-variety users creates technical debt
   - Metrics show "success" while value delivery fails
   - The real measure should be variety-matched utilization

3. **Believing prompt engineering solves variety constraints**
   - Prompts can only activate variety the human can specify
   - Low-variety humans cannot write high-variety prompts
   - The constraint is human capability, not prompt quality

4. **Ignoring variety stunting in junior staff**
   - AI use prevents variety-building experiences
   - Juniors mistake AI's variety for their own
   - Long-term organizational capability degrades

5. **Mistaking pre-packaged variety for organizational capability**
   - Turnkey systems provide temporary access to embedded variety
   - Organizations cannot modify, extend, or debug
   - Dependency without understanding creates fragility

6. **Confusing speed with effectiveness**
   - Pressure for quick decisions eliminates recursive depth
   - "Rubber stamp" approvals skip risk assessment and implication analysis
   - What seems like efficiency is actually removed quality control
   - Fast but shallow decisions create downstream failures

## Part V: A Strategic Framework for Building Effective Human-AI Systems

The analytical insights derived from the AI Sandwich Systems Model and the principle of requisite variety form the basis of a robust, prescriptive framework for designing, deploying, and managing human-AI systems for long-term success. Here we translate diagnostic findings into actionable principles and strategic recommendations for organizations, system designers, and individuals, shifting the focus from technological implementation to the cultivation of human capability.

### Actionable Principles for Variety-Centric System Design

System designers and architects bear primary responsibility for creating environments where effective human-AI collaboration can occur. A variety-centric design philosophy moves beyond user experience (UX) toward creating systems that explicitly acknowledge and manage the capabilities of their users. This requires adherence to new principles:

- **Make Complexity and Uncertainty Visible:** Systems should not hide their inner workings in pursuit of a "magical" user experience. For complex operations, especially those involving sequential chains or recursion, the system's interface should visualize the steps being taken. More importantly, when an AI model's confidence in an output is low, this uncertainty must be surfaced to the user.[^29] An AI that can say "I don't know" or provide a confidence score is vastly more useful than one that is "confidently wrong," as it allows the human to allocate their critical attention effectively.

- **Design for Variety Matching:** A one-size-fits-all interface is a one-size-fits-none solution. Systems should be designed to adapt to the user's variety level.
  - **For Novices (Low Variety):** Provide scaffolding, templates, and guided workflows. Offer proactive suggestions and clear explanations. The system should act as a tutor, creating "desirable difficulties" that build the user's skills.
  - **For Experts (High Variety):** Provide "power tools," APIs, and deep customization options. Minimize cognitive overhead by allowing them to bypass introductory steps and interact with the system's core logic directly. The goal is to reduce the "translation cost" for the expert.

- **Enable Graceful Degradation at Variety Limits:** The system must anticipate and manage situations where the user's variety is insufficient for the task at hand. When a user struggles to formulate a coherent prompt or repeatedly accepts low-quality outputs, the system should not simply continue to function. Instead, it could suggest involving a human expert, recommend a relevant training module, or require mandatory peer review before the output can be finalized. This principle aligns with HCI guidelines that emphasize managing errors gracefully.[^9]

- **Prioritize Explainability as a Regulatory Tool:** AI explainability (XAI) is often framed as a means to build user trust. A variety-centric view reframes it as a critical tool for regulation. An explanation allows a human to apply their own contextual knowledge and domain expertise (their variety) to audit the AI's reasoning process. This is the primary mechanism by which a human regulator can check the work of the system being regulated. Therefore, investing in explainability is a direct investment in the regulatory capacity of the overall human-AI system.

### Organizational Strategy: Investing in Human Variety as the Primary Enabler

The ultimate conclusion: The primary bottleneck to realizing the value of artificial intelligence is not the sophistication of the technology, but the adaptive capacity - the variety - of the people who must wield it. Therefore, the foundational investment for a successful AI transformation is not in AI licenses, but in people.

- **Build Human Variety First:** Before large-scale AI deployment, organizations must conduct a "variety assessment" of their workforce. Where are the pockets of expertise? Where are the skill gaps? The first step should be to launch initiatives aimed at increasing the overall variety of the organization: robust training programs, mentorship structures that connect novices with experts, and job rotations that expose employees to different contexts.[^40] Research shows that organizations that develop internal AI skills consistently see better results than those who rely on external consultants.[^40]

- **Preserve Productive Friction:** Leaders must resist the temptation to eliminate all challenge in the name of efficiency. They must recognize that practices like mandatory code reviews, peer feedback, and structured critical analysis are not bureaucratic impediments; they are the organization's primary mechanisms for building collective variety and ensuring quality. The integration of AI should augment these processes, not replace them. For instance, an AI can assist in a code review by flagging potential issues, but it should not eliminate the need for a human expert to make the final judgment. This preserves the "desirable difficulty" that is crucial for skill development in junior staff, preventing the "skill-stunting" effect where AI use hinders learning.[^47]

- **Match Deployment to Variety:** AI tools should not be deployed universally. Instead, they should be rolled out strategically, targeting users and use cases where a variety match exists. High-powered, generative tools should be given first to high-variety experts who can manage their risks and unlock their potential. Simpler, more constrained AI tools can be deployed to novices, with clear guardrails and oversight. This selective deployment strategy accepts the reality of the "Adoption Valley" and manages it proactively, rather than ignoring it.

- **Cultivate a Culture of Productive Doubt:** The most important cultural shift is to move from an environment that demands certainty to one that values inquiry. Leaders must model intellectual humility, openly questioning their own assumptions and encouraging their teams to do the same.[^36] Success should be defined not by the absence of failure, but by the speed of learning. This creates the psychological safety required for employees to challenge AI outputs, report unexpected behaviors, and engage in the double-loop learning that drives genuine innovation.[^34]

- **Inoculate Against Borrowed Variety:** Organizations must distinguish between temporary capability (borrowed from tools) and permanent competence (built through understanding). The seductive ease of turnkey AI platforms can create a dangerous illusion of organizational capability that evaporates when the tool fails or needs adaptation.

### Practical Implementation Steps

Building effective human-AI systems requires concrete action at multiple levels:

#### For Organizations:
1. **Assess current variety distribution in staff** - Map expertise levels across teams
2. **Identify threshold-variety populations** - Find users at the optimal point in the adoption valley
3. **Design variety-building programs** - Create structured learning experiences that build capability
4. **Deploy AI selectively based on variety matching** - Match tools to user capabilities
5. **Monitor effective utilization, not adoption** - Track value creation, not usage metrics
6. **Maintain internal "first principles" expertise** - Keep at least a core team who understand underlying mechanisms, not just interfaces
7. **Create "variety checkpoints"** - Before major AI deployments, assess whether sufficient internal variety exists to manage the tool effectively
8. **Require "look under the hood" sessions** - Regularly dissect AI outputs to understand how they were generated

#### For Individuals:
1. **Recognize your current variety level honestly** - Self-assess without ego
2. **Use AI within your variety constraints** - Don't exceed your evaluation capability
3. **Focus on variety-building experiences** - Seek challenges that expand understanding
4. **Don't mistake AI's variety for your own** - Maintain awareness of whose capability is active
5. **Gradually expand variety through deliberate practice** - Build skills systematically
6. **Implement personal "AI-free" exercises** - Periodically solve problems without AI assistance to maintain and validate your variety
7. **Document the "why" behind AI recommendations** - Force yourself to articulate reasoning to prevent blind acceptance

#### For System Designers:
1. **Make variety requirements explicit** - Document needed expertise levels
2. **Design for variety matching at interfaces** - Create adaptive interfaces for different users
3. **Provide variety scaffolding for users** - Build in learning support
4. **Monitor variety boundaries in operation** - Track where users struggle
5. **Enable graceful degradation at variety limits** - Fail safely when variety is insufficient
6. **Build "show your work" features** - Make AI reasoning processes visible and inspectable, not hidden behind "magic"
7. **Include variety-building friction** - Design deliberate checkpoints that require users to engage with underlying concepts
8. **Provide "escape hatches" to raw functionality** - Allow high-variety users to bypass abstractions and access core capabilities directly

## Conclusion: The Primacy of the Interface - Why Human Variety Will Determine the Future of AI

The AI Sandwich Systems Model, when rigorously examined through the lens of cybernetics, cognitive science, and empirical research, proves to be a remarkably robust and insightful framework. It correctly identifies the fundamental architecture of human-AI collaboration and, through its connection to Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety, reveals the non-negotiable principle that governs the success of all such systems: the necessity of matching capability at every interface.

**Core truths validated through this analysis:**
- The Human-AI-Human sandwich is a universal pattern for managing risk, but its effectiveness is always bounded by the variety of its human layers
- The immense potential of an AI model is rendered irrelevant if the human cannot articulate a sufficiently complex problem or critically evaluate the proposed solution
- As AI becomes more powerful, the need for sophisticated human judgment, context, and expertise does not decrease - it increases
- The more capable the filling, the more robust the bread must be

The implications for strategy are profound and urgent. The prevailing technology-first approach to AI transformation is fundamentally flawed. It's a recipe for generating vast quantities of unverified, low-quality output, accumulating massive hidden technical debt, and stunting the skill development of the next generation of workers. The case studies of enterprise AI failure are not tales of bad algorithms; they are parables of misaligned systems, of organizations that deployed powerful tools without first cultivating the human capacity to regulate them.

The path forward requires a radical inversion of priorities. The multi-million-dollar question is not "How do we implement AI?" but "How do we build the human variety necessary to utilize AI effectively?" Success will not belong to the organizations with the most advanced models, but to those that cultivate the most capable people. It will belong to those who understand that AI is a variety amplifier, not a variety creator, and that an amplifier is only as good as the signal it receives. The future of artificial intelligence will ultimately be determined by the investment we make in our own.

Rational Animations, "Can Non-Experts Train AI to Beat Experts?", accessed September 9, 2025, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mco9zAamRk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mco9zAamRk)

This video explores Ajeya Cotra's "sandwiching" proposal for scalable oversight - using non-experts to align AI models that exceed their expertise but remain below expert-level performance. While focused on AI alignment rather than human-AI collaboration, it addresses a meta-problem: how humans with limited variety can effectively oversee systems with greater variety. The research by Bowman et al. on "Measuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models" provides empirical validation of challenges when human variety is insufficient for the oversight task - a complementary perspective to the variety-matching principles presented in this document.
