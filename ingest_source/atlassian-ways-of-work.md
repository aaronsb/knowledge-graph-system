# Atlassian's Ways of Work: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

Atlassian's Ways of Work represents a comprehensive philosophy about how modern, distributed teams can work together most effectively. Developed through over two decades of experience supporting technology-driven organizations and backed by rigorous research from their Teamwork Lab, these approaches are designed to "unleash the potential of every team" — whether in technology, finance, government, or any other sector.

**Core Philosophy:** At Atlassian, they believe teamwork itself should work. Their mission centers on the idea that great things are impossible alone, but making progress together can be hard. The Ways of Work framework provides practical, evidence-based guidance to make collaboration easier, more transparent, and more impactful.

## The System of Work: Four Foundational Principles

Atlassian's System of Work serves as the philosophical backbone for their Ways of Work. It's built on four interconnected principles that accelerate progress and maximize team impact:

### 1. **Align Work to Goals**

Companies focus on the right things when work aligns to goals and all goals are visible across all teams. Teams with clear, trackable goals are 20% more effective.

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Create ambitious goals that stretch teams just beyond their comfort zones
- Make goals visible organization-wide so everyone understands priorities
- Limit the number of strategic objectives (Atlassian uses only 3 company-wide objectives)
- Ensure each goal states what you want to achieve and how you'll measure success
- Update goals when they no longer align to top strategic priorities
- When everyone can see each other's goals and which projects drive them, silos and redundant work decrease

### 2. **Plan and Track Work Together**

Organizations make faster progress when teams share an understanding of the "who, what, when and how" behind their work.

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Document progress on tasks and update status in real time
- Share weekly updates that include potential risks and key accomplishments
- Plan for key reflection points throughout project cycles (pre-mortems, midpoint check-ins, post-mortems)
- Set up clear escalation channels so teams can quickly get leadership support when needed
- Outline clear deadlines for project phases and review progress every two weeks
- When teams plan and track work in consistent ways, they can devote 13% more time to the work that matters

### 3. **Unleash Collective Knowledge**

Teams are easily able to find the exact answers they need when they document, share and harness their collective knowledge. The latest State of Teams 2025 report found that teams spend over 25% of their workweek searching for information.

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Create a go-to place for information about goals, projects, and teams
- Build simple habits to keep documentation current
- Override the instinct to ping colleagues when seeking information — search existing documentation first
- Replace information-sharing meetings with high-quality written materials and videos
- When meetings do happen, document decisions and context so they become part of shared knowledge
- Focus on what your audience needs to know and why it matters — don't overcomplicate things

### 4. **Embed AI as Part of the Team**

Successful teams embed AI as part of the team, encourage AI experimentation, and build with agents to unlock new levels of innovation and efficiency.

**What This Means in Practice:**
- Approach AI as a creative partner or team with specialized skills, not just an automated tool
- Work with AI to transform scattered data into useful insights at every workflow step
- Empower teams to quickly gain expert insights — AI efficiently synthesizes and analyzes large datasets
- Strategic AI collaborators are 1.8x more likely than simple AI users to be seen as innovative teammates
- Encourage experimentation with AI to bring ideas to life, not just automate repetitive tasks

## The Teamwork Lab: Research-Backed Insights

Atlassian's Teamwork Lab is a dedicated research arm led by behavioral scientists who study the challenges of modern work and develop evidence-backed practices. Their ongoing State of Teams research provides macro-level insights and actionable recommendations.

### Key Research Findings on What Works:

**Psychological Safety is Paramount**
- If a team had to focus on only one thing, they should focus on psychological safety. With psychological safety, everything else becomes easier — it becomes easier to be aligned, connected, and innovative
- Psychological safety is consistently one of the strongest predictors of team performance, productivity, quality, safety, creativity, and innovation
- Teams with psychological safety are more willing to report mistakes, share concerns, and take calculated risks

**Open Work Style Drives Performance**
- Teams who work with an open style are 60% more likely to achieve more faster, and 80% more likely to report high emotional well-being
- Open work style includes: public recognition of wins, addressing performance issues proactively, and celebrating team accomplishments regularly

**Location Doesn't Determine Success**
- It's not where you work that matters, but how you work. Healthy teams are found in all working environments: co-located in an office, fully remote, or a hybrid of the two
- The flexibility to work in the location of one's choosing significantly improves outcomes related to innovation, wellbeing, burnout, and perceptions of organizational culture

**Recognition Matters More Than You Think**
- Members of teams with a habit of expressing appreciation and encouragement reported higher levels of psychological safety and had a more positive view of their organization's culture, which is associated with stronger intentions to stay at the company long-term
- Simple recognition can improve a team's sense of well-being by up to 16 percentage points

**Clear Goals Accelerate Collaboration**
- Teams with clear goals are 4.5x more likely to collaborate effectively and get work done faster
- Teams with clear goals are 20% more productive

## The Team Playbook: Practical Plays for Better Teamwork

The Team Playbook contains practical, step-by-step guides to tackle common teamwork challenges — not resources that wax poetic about virtues of sound collaboration, but tried-and-tested methods

**What are Plays?**
Plays are free workshop resources designed to address common team challenges and start important conversations. Each Play was created and tested by Atlassian teams first before being published. Running Plays regularly can improve team performance by 15-20%

**Key Plays Include:**
- **Health Monitor:** Assess team health across eight attributes to identify strengths and areas for improvement
- **Working Agreements:** Create shared norms for how teams work together, communicate, and collaborate
- **Goals, Signals, Measures:** Define what objectives to achieve and track progress with measurable key results
- **DACI Decision-Making:** Assign clear roles to ensure effective collaboration and accountability during decision-making
- **Project Poster:** Build consensus on objectives, timing, scope, and decision-making
- **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarify individual responsibilities and find gaps that need to be filled
- **Retrospective:** Reflect on completed projects to continuously improve processes

## The Ways of Working Offering

Atlassian's Ways of Working offering codifies and shares the lessons they've learned about modern teamwork to peers, customers, and business leaders. No other company pairs their products and practices to improve the way teams work quite like Atlassian does.

### Modern Work Coaches

Modern Work Coaches roll up their sleeves and dive into customers' ways of working to understand the root of collaboration pain points and then run custom-designed plays in-person or virtually to help teams improve

The coaches address various use cases:
- Evaluating and prioritizing work rituals
- Improving team meetings
- Establishing team vision and goals
- Enhancing communication patterns
- Building alignment across distributed teams

### Core Philosophy

Products alone don't unleash the potential of teams. Unleashing your team's potential is activated by how the products are used and how the work gets done

This is why Atlassian focuses on the "who, how, and why" of work — not just the "what" and the tools used to accomplish it.

## Distributed Work: Team Anywhere

Given that nearly 40% of Atlassian's staff lives 2+ hours from the closest office, they've had to be purposeful about staying ahead of effective teamwork in distributed environments.

### Three Transformations for Distributed Teams:

1. **Organize teams by time zones, not zip codes** — ensure sufficient overlap of working hours between people who work together most
2. **Design and run offices like a product** — where employees can choose whether to attend, and the experience is elevated when they do
3. **Use technology to connect teams no matter where they sit** — implementing the System of Work to enable seamless collaboration

### Key Practices for Distributed Teams:
- Replace synchronous meetings with asynchronous communication where possible
- Use video messages (like Loom) to share updates and reduce meeting time
- Document everything to create a searchable, accessible knowledge base
- Be intentional about scheduling one-on-one meetings for connection
- Model boundaries and set clear expectations for communication

## Eight Factors That Influence Team Health

Atlassian's research has identified eight interconnected factors that determine whether a team is healthy:

1. **Alignment** — clarity on goals, priorities, and how work connects to company strategy
2. **Cohesion** — personal connections and trust between team members
3. **Psychological Safety** — ability to take risks and be vulnerable without fear
4. **Innovation Potential** — space and encouragement to try new things
5. **Value & Metrics** — understanding of what success looks like and how it's measured
6. **Balanced Team** — right mix of skills, roles, and workload distribution
7. **Shared Understanding** — common context about the work and its importance
8. **Dependencies** — clarity on what the team needs from others and vice versa

## What Sets This Philosophy Apart

Atlassian's Ways of Work is distinctive because:

1. **It's tested internally first:** Atlassian practices new processes and innovates new ways of working before releasing them for customer adaptation. Having a distributed workforce allows them to experiment at scale

2. **It's grounded in behavioral science:** The Teamwork Lab conducts rigorous research to validate practices, not just share anecdotes

3. **It's accessible to everyone:** The Team Playbook and research findings are available for free to any team in the world

4. **It acknowledges imperfection:** Atlassian openly states their journey hasn't been perfect and they don't have all the answers — they're offering tried-and-tested methods that can help teams improve, even if only by a degree or two

5. **It's tool-agnostic at its core:** While Atlassian develops software, the Ways of Work principles apply regardless of what tools teams use. The focus is on human collaboration patterns, not software features

## Implementing the Ways of Work

**Start Small and Iterate:**
- Choose one Play to run with your team
- Use the Health Monitor to identify your biggest pain points
- Focus on one principle of the System of Work at a time
- Measure progress and adjust based on what works for your specific team

**Focus on Behaviors, Not Tools:**
- The Ways of Work is about changing how people interact and collaborate
- Technology can enable these behaviors, but can't replace them
- Success comes from consistent practice and leadership modeling

**Prioritize Psychological Safety:**
- This is the foundation that makes everything else easier
- Leaders must model vulnerability and create space for honest conversation
- Celebrate both successes and failures as learning opportunities

**Make Knowledge Accessible:**
- Reduce time spent searching for information
- Document decisions and context, not just outputs
- Create shared sources of truth for goals, projects, and team information

## The Bottom Line

Atlassian's Ways of Work represents a fundamental belief: **teamwork should work**. By aligning around shared goals, planning and tracking work transparently, unleashing collective knowledge, and thoughtfully integrating AI, teams can overcome the friction that makes collaboration difficult.

The philosophy isn't about perfection — it's about continuous improvement through evidence-based practices that help teams be slightly better today than they were yesterday. When implemented thoughtfully, these ways of working create environments where people feel safe to innovate, clear about priorities, connected to colleagues, and empowered to do their best work — regardless of where they sit or what tools they use.
