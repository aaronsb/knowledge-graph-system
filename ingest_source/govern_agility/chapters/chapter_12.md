## Chapter 12: Using the Stanchions in the Real World

Exploring the history and methodologies behind the five stanchions of Agile
Governance in theory is all well and good, but our model was designed for the
real world. To begin applying these learnings to your own organizational
governance, we must start with a brief recap of the stanchions and why we use
them.
   The five stanchions of Agile Governance are the bedrock of human-centric
governance. Regardless of whether your organization is agile, traditional,
hybrid, or built upon a model we haven’t yet named, these stanchions will
function as the connective tissue between tools, methods, processes, ways of
thinking and communicating, and more.
   The first stanchion, Conductive Leadership, helps us shift from mechanistic
to humanistic approaches. It asks leaders to guide and support colleagues like a
conductor in an orchestra, providing synchronization and alignment without
direct control.
   The second, Sensible Transparency, aids the speed of information flow. This
aids in decision-making and increases trust, without which organizations can’t
create true agility or achieve success in a VUCA world.
   Third, we have Patterns of Work. This stanchion asks us to question the
processes, tools, mindsets, and systems used to conduct our work and complete
tasks. Good patterns of work can help us to optimize and evolve; bad patterns
of work will sink the ship.
   Next is Data-Driven Reasoning, which explores how, what, and why we
measure in the workplace. What data actually helps improve the ways we work,
and how can we collect and process that data to match the speed of change in
today’s modern business environment?
   Last, but absolutely not least, is Humanity as the Cornerstone. This
stanchion asks us to toss away mechanistic controls and invest in trust, by
making workers the caretakers and captains of good governance.
   Put these five stanchions together, and you have a collection of dynamic
ideas and questions that can be applied to any workplace or system of
governance. However, actually applying them in the real world may seem
daunting.
   To get you started, let’s peel away the curtain and explore how we’ve applied
each of the five stanchions in real-world studies.
Our Clients
We’ve helped countless clients improve their businesses by examining their
governance through the lens of the five stanchions. For the rest of this chapter
we’ll draw on three of those clients to help illustrate our ways of working, and
how you can take these processes and mindsets and apply them to your own
governance. The first of these three clients was the government body (for the
purposes of this book, we will call them GovCo from here on in). They had
begun to digitize many of their services. This initiative had a realistic, multi-
year scope and time frame, and the delivery team had adopted many agile
principles, including creating a specifically tailored agile way of working.
   This new way of working had a proven track record of successful delivery
and had earned the backing of the executive team. However, these changes had
the side effect of challenging the status quo in terms of how the organization
governed the work.
   We were brought in primarily to investigate, assess, and advise. Our focus
was to examine the ways in which agile was being adopted, and provide
assurance that these new ways of working and governing would provide the
necessary oversight and controls to meet the expectations of leadership,
stakeholders, and government.
   The second client we’ll be exploring in these examples is a global
organization (let’s call them InsureCo). We worked with them for over three
years, during which time the company in question wanted to better
understand the way they identified, triaged, prioritized, and delivered their
work. This understanding would help them to transition away from three-year
plans and annualized investment slates to more adaptive, agile ways of
working.
   We were asked to work as both consultants and enablers of work. Our job
was to gather and analyze all the information we could pertaining to their
governance framework, then use the five stanchions to create an ongoing
backlog of improvement initiatives. In turn, this would help our client uplift
the way they delivered value to their customers.
    Finally, we’ll draw upon learnings from our time developing the Remote
Agility Framework (Remote:af ). In the early days of the COVID-19
pandemic, we were afforded the opportunity to become co-creators of this
framework, which allowed us to synthesize and incorporate the thinking we
had developed on the five stanchions into a remote context and, in turn,
challenge the ubiquity of the model. We’d already been using the stanchions of
Agile Governance in several of our engagements (although we were still
developing and codifying them), so this was a great opportunity to distribute
the elements of our Agile Governance into a new context, while taking the
time to research, learn, and educate others on the principles of effective Agile
Governance.
    The result of our work with the Remote Agility Framework was that
Remote:af incorporates the stanchions in what are called the “Pillars of Remote
Governance”: transparency, leadership, systems, and information. These are the
Stanchions you’ve previously learned about, but specifically viewed through a
remote lens—and after carefully testing, redesigning, and trialing the core
patterns that now make up the framework, we found that the stanchions were
largely applicable to a remote context as well. We just had to carefully consider
the additional factors unique to the remote landscape, which we were able to
test and implement quickly thanks to the support of the founders of the
Remote:af. They had a vested interest in getting it right, fast. They needed to
shift quickly to a remote-friendly way of working or their business wouldn’t
survive.
    We’ll now explore the five stanchions from our work on the ground within
these three organizations. These engagements will illuminate the five
stanchions from different, complementary angles, and demonstrate how they
can be practically applied in your own environment.
12.1 Conductive Leadership in the Real World
When working with any of our clients, understanding the state of their
leadership was critical to assisting the growth and development of their
governance.
    In the case of GovCo, part of our initial mandate was to determine whether
their existing governance was fit for purpose. Key to this was understanding
how leadership functioned in a traditionally constrained, bureaucratic
environment. Could we transform their leadership from conservative to open
and agile? How would this affect communication and collaboration, or
employees and their roles?
    Our role centered around conductive leadership and InsureCo shared some
similarities with what we were attempting to achieve at GovCo. Creating
conductive leadership is primarily about shifting away from traditional
management’s task-based approaches. We wanted to show leaders at this
organization an alternative: how to think about outcomes when providing a
problem to solve, giving their teams clarity around constraints and available
resources, and working in sync with teams to help solve that problem.
    In both organizations, our goal was to help leaders develop the ways in
which they led and the systems underpinning their leadership styles.
    We started our examination of leadership by breaking down how people
made decisions. But examining how decision-making was distributed and
managed at GovCo was no small task. We broke it down into three key areas
to focus on:

      1. Was authority being taken to the work? Were stakeholders and users
      alike able to give direct feedback to the team, via avenues such as
      showcases or backlog refinement sessions? Wherever possible, we helped
      empower those actually doing the work on the ground, and tightened
      feedback loops to improve the speed of progress.
      2. When we drilled further into feedback loops, we asked: were the
      rituals and processes in place (like daily scrums and sprints) actually
      helping to enable adaptive change and accelerate change requests? A
      large part of this was examining whether the daily standup or its
      equivalent helped tell the story of what the current project meant to the
      customer. Storytelling is a vital part of bringing testers along on the
      journey and helping them build empathy for the customer, thus creating
      faster, more accurate feedback. Every step we took to integrate this story
      into daily rituals aided in tightening their feedback loop.
      3. We considered User Research, and asked whether it was doing what it
      said on the tin: was the research being conducted actually resulting in
      better design, better engagement, and concrete trust in the product
      between teams and customers, both internal and external? Or were the
      results of research not being placed in the hands of those who could
      make those crucial decisions?

    Decision-making at InsureCo was no less complex. We found that,
although great decisions were being made at a delivery level, they often ended
up re-prosecuted at the management level. The appetite to work differently was
there, and the executive leadership group was doing everything right in
empowering their teams, but the system itself always slammed on the brakes.
    This was a severe constraint upon effective work. It prompted us to ask:
what other constraints were in effect? By asking teams to share what they
perceived as constraints upon their ways of working, we soon learned that it
was critical to determine whether these were real or only perceived. It’s not
uncommon for teams and individuals to run up against real constraints and
rationalize them away instead of addressing them. It’s just as common for
people to hit what they believe is a constraint, but is actually a simple, easily
solved miscommunication.
    By asking these questions, we found instances where people felt they had no
decision-making power or were unable to move forward with projects, but
after some investigation found these concerns weren’t actually valid. For
example, individuals felt they were limited by the status quo, but there was no
actual policy in place to prevent them from moving forward. Other constraints
were explicit, where we found the need for leaders to step in and give direction
to break through boundaries.
    What we were quickly learning from both engagements was that clearer,
faster communication was at the heart of many leadership issues. This echoed
what we discovered when helping build the Remote Agility Framework. Our
biggest discovery when taking leadership into a remote framework was that it
was crucial for leaders to identify the most important information to amplify
and find ways to increase the volume of that message in both synchronous and
asynchronous contexts.
   Without this focus, critical messages—like which constraints were being felt
most keenly at InsureCo, or whether daily scrums were effective at GovCo—
were being lost. Leaders were doing their best but their insights or requests for
data were being lost. In fact, through our work at Remote:af, we learned that
this was having both a mental and physical impact upon the leadership. The
move to remote, coupled with a decrease in control over teams thanks to the
loss of “management by walking around” or the typical watercooler directional
chat, meant that leaders were doing less natural, supportive, conductive
leadership, and more thirty-minute meetings. So many in fact that some
leaders were booked out with back-to-back meetings, leaving no time to
actually reflect upon the data, plan solutions, or execute quick, collegial
conversations.
   Leaders intended to be more conductive. The frameworks in place simply
didn’t allow it.
   Conductive leadership and leading with intent are parallel, mutually
supportive leadership models. When we dug into conductive leadership at
GovCo, our first observation was that the intent part of intent-based leadership
was already present. The problem was that the system was managing and
governing itself in a way that ran counter to what the intent required. This was
a result of the leadership approach evolving in such a way that it now
interfered with the organization achieving its intent.
   Ownership and responsibility were also a concern. We examined the
processes people followed while working and discovered that while some of
those processes were well-defined, others were vague and ill-formed. People
were executing processes blindly and taking little responsibility for the
outcomes. In fact, end-to-end ownership of processes and outcomes was
consistently missing throughout InsureCo.
   Ownership of processes at GovCo was no less complex. The CEO and
steering committee understood the value of giving their teams control over a
backlog prioritized on business value, but some members of the leadership
found it difficult to take their hands off the steering wheel. Certain leads
would regularly override the decisions of teams, and ask for immediate pivots
that provided no real business value. In short, executives had set some broad
guide rails for work, yet when it came time to step back and let that work
happen, they got itchy fingers. The result: unproductive teams and tangled
backlogs.
    This mirrored what we were learning at Remote:af. It was becoming
increasingly apparent that success in a remote context relied heavily upon
leadership setting clear guide rails that allowed people to work without the
constant need for approval or direction… and to then step away and trust
those guide rails to operate as intended. Working with poorly formed or vague
guide rails was a disaster waiting to happen, especially as teams were becoming
more distributed due to lockdowns and remote work. The knee-jerk response
of some organizations when they lost visual management control was to create
more guide rails. What we observed was that a smorgasbord of guide rails was
much worse for workers than only a few guide rails designed with quality and
clarity.
    Of course, setting good guide rails is easy to say and harder to do, as we’d
seen at InsureCo. Harder still when working entirely via remote.
    We found that creating good guide rails in a remote context required
purposeful thinking about an organization’s decision-making framework and
all its nuances, especially the levels of delegation. We also found that clarity
was required around what was a guide rail and what was a constraint.
Depending on clarity of communication and quality of leadership, there can
sometimes be confusion between “Design like this because we’re limited by X,
Y, and Z” versus “Design like this because it synergizes well with our sibling-
team’s patterns of working”, or even “Design like this because I say so”. We
needed leaders to draw a clear line between supportive, guiding, conductive
guide rails versus constraints—and then make purposeful decisions so that
teams could identify, elevate, challenge, or even remove constraints in their
path without dismantling the guide rails.
    To achieve this, we found that some guide rails could be set centrally and
encompass large swathes of the organization. Others could be set locally, to
solve local problems. This ensured that nobody was dancing around irrelevant
guide rails, people had the maximum freedom possible to work within the set
boundaries, and leaders could focus on making sure the guide rails they created
were communicated clearly and transparently.
    We had an opportunity to apply a lot of this methodology during our work
at GovCo and InsureCo. The key difference between the two engagements was
that, when working with GovCo, we had the mandate to step in and make
these changes directly. In our time at GovCo, our role was to act as consultants
and advisors, helping existing leadership become more conductive without
assertively steering the direction of teams ourselves.
    This meant we couldn’t simply step in and begin establishing guide rails,
mandating the use of specific leadership processes, or switching up feedback
loops to better enable adaptive change. We had to lead the collective horses of
leadership to water, but we couldn’t force them to drink.
    This caused some difficulties when we learned that, among the executive
level at GovCo, none had any formal agile training. They had an awareness of
agility, and some even acted in ways they believed were agile, such as the
previously mentioned pivots or backlog shakeups to match what they believed
were immediate customer needs. Some believed that they didn’t need to adhere
to methodologies, frameworks, or even the five stanchions. They were
executives, after all! They had a different understanding of the work, and
exercised power accordingly.
    This meant that, before we could dig into questions like whether user
research was being utilized to its fullest, or whether authority was being taken
to the work, we had to begin with foundational training. Back to the basics:
agile fundamentals and terminology like stories and sprints.
    It’s important to flag that an approach like this required trust between us
and leadership, which served as an opportunity to model the sort of trust
required between leadership and their teams. It also required significant
emotional investment from leaders. None of this would have worked as well as
it did if they hadn’t wanted to become great conductive leaders. Thankfully, the
investment was already strong, and we were able to demonstrate for them the
value of Conductive Leadership as a stanchion of great governance.
    While trust at GovCo was strong, things weren’t so rosy at InsureCo. They
had a strong focus on accountability, which led to a focus on task completion
but a lack of trust between leaders and teams. This was the same across
different domains throughout the organization. We needed to find a way to
take the trust built inside silos and extend it across the company as a whole.
This required building cross functional teams focused on solving problems
rather than executing tasks to deliver change. The first of these are now
launched and working, with more soon to come. It’s these teams that provide
the vehicle to really drive the shift from accountability to responsibility.
   We also helped to build trust in the teams by demonstrating that we were
invested in their growth and future success. A critical element of Conductive
Leadership is to ensure your team is competent and capable today, tomorrow,
and far into the future. That means planning ahead for ongoing or even
continuous training and broadening of skills, so teams can stay effective
regardless of what the future brings. When we first came to GovCo we heard
that their teams were lacking skills and capabilities for the now, let alone the
future. Teams knew it, and it had an impact upon morale.
   We recommended they look at what skills were increasing in relevance and
focus—digital, data, and analytical skills—and begin building training into
their weekly schedules. This is something we feel is a function of leadership. It
should be leaders who examine the overall capabilities of teams, have foresight
and vision, and invest accordingly in training opportunities. It’s also up to
leaders to make sure their teams have appropriate time to let those lessons sink
in before a crisis emerges to test them.
   To those who ask, “What if we invest in employee training and then they
take the skills we paid for to other companies?” We refer them to this (possibly
apocryphal) quote from Henry Ford: “The only thing worse than training your
employees and having them leave, is not training them and having them stay.”
   These shifts to effective, conductive, remote leadership have had
quantifiable results—not just for our clients, but across the board. During our
work with Remote:af we communicated with multiple organizations and
found that those implementing good remote leadership processes had increased
productivity of their development teams by upwards of 30%, measured by
team data. That would be spectacular in any year, let alone during a pandemic.
But these organizations were doing it right: leading by increasing trust in their
remote teams, setting clear guide rails, and then allowing their employees to
tackle problems as they felt best. It turned out that increased flexibility,
coupled with feeling trusted and valued by leaders, correlated with better
output. Shocking! Which is why we are now baffled by organizations
mandating returns to the office—why would you go against all the data
demonstrating that hybrid models are better for everyone? That’s a whole other
story around traditional leadership philosophy, and not for today.
   We saw similar growth towards the end of our engagement with both
InsureCo and GovCo. In the case of the former, leadership had started to shift
conversation away from tactical management and toward strategic leadership.
The executive level was asking new and different questions, and the leadership
teams were getting access to new data to support different ways of thinking.
The executive team has put in place their first Obeya to provide the space for
leaders to come together regularly and collaborate on moving forward their
critical strategic programs.
    When exploring the stanchion of Conductive Leadership in your own
organization, there are a thousand places you could begin. Let’s simplify that
approach down to five key exercises that can help you start working on
conductive and effective leadership in a remote context:

      1. Leadership Self-Assessment: Start off by honestly evaluating your
      present leadership practices and style. Analyze the way in which your
      choices are made, how you share information, and how that affects the
      development of trust among your teams. Determine what needs to be
      improved to encourage a more conductive and successful leadership
      style. The results of this self-evaluation will help you identify the areas of
      your leadership that require improvement.
      2. Establish Clear Guide Rails: Regardless of the environment you are
      working in, remote or traditional, look to setting clear guide rails for
      your teams. Use these guide rails to define the boundaries within which
      teams can operate, allowing them the autonomy to make decisions
      without constant approval or micro-management. And remember that
      clarity around what is a supportive guide rail and what is a constraint is
      an important step to Conductive Leadership.
      3. Build Trust within the Teams and the Leaders: Work towards
      fostering greater trust and collaboration between leadership and teams
      by focusing on problem-solving and outcomes rather than just task
      completion. This shift from accountability to responsibility creates an
      environment where the people feel empowered and supported in their
      growth and success.
      4. Prioritize Communication and Feedback Loops: Look at how you
      can improve communication and tighten feedback loops to enable
      adaptive change. Ensure that critical messages are not lost, and insights
      are properly shared and acted upon. Effective communication is
      essential for Conductive Leadership, particularly in remote settings
      where face-to-face interactions are limited.
      5. Invest in Continuous Training and Skills Development: Ensure
      your teams have the skills and capabilities needed not only for current
      work but also for future challenges. Invest in ongoing or continuous
      training opportunities to keep people effective and prepared for what
      lies ahead.

   By taking these actions you can begin the journey towards Conductive
Leadership, creating a more agile, effective, and responsive organization,
regardless of whether it is a traditional office or remote environment.
12.2 Sensible Transparency in the Real World
Exploring sensible transparency during our three primary engagements—with
GovCo, InsureCo, and while developing the Remote Agility Framework—was
a profound demonstration of the value of the five stanchions. Each of these
three engagements required us to consider transparency from different angles
—the purpose, value, and when it was appropriate and when it was not—but
the answers were always found by returning to the foundational principles of
sensible transparency through the lens of Remote Governance.
   When we first arrived at GovCo and began to break down which parts of
their governance were working and which weren’t, we reviewed their
transparency from a number of perspectives. First, we considered clarity of
purpose and intent. This is a critical factor in Agile Governance which can be
considered as part of the Conductive Leadership stanchion as much as it can
the stanchion of Sensible Transparency.
   When observing how this organization managed clarity of purpose and
intent, we asked a few key questions: were teams generally operating using a
disciplined funnel of work to balance demand? Did they have a function in
place to ensure they managed requests in a fashion within their capacity? If
not, how could we help them build such a funnel?
   Were teams operating with certainty? Did their backlog refinement and
replanning sessions give the teams confidence that they were building the right
things, or were their backlogs a series of stabs in the dark? Or worse still, were
their backlogs being used as dumping grounds for features that never again saw
the light of day?
   When it came to benefit realization, we asked: who bore the onus of
responsibility? Were Business Owners and the Steering Committee solely
accountable for this? Or were there clear links between Product Features and
Integration & Business Change, and further links to benefits and objectives,
which provided teams with clarity on the needs and outcomes of feature
development, and thus distributed the onus for benefit realization? We also
examined business and customer input, and how it related to clarity of
purpose. Were customers being asked for input, and if so, were their insights
actually being used in a practical way to define further work?
   We closely examined the role of the Product Owners within GovCo and
considered how they aided in, or obstructed, clarity of purpose and intent.
Were they working effectively in their roles and helping to build business
understanding? Were they correctly aligned to the relevant customer user
groups? Or were they operating in traditional ways that isolated them from
customer feedback and needs—a mere changing of the guard from a Business
Analyst to a Product Owner in name only?
    Finally, we considered whether strategic intent was properly linked to
delivery via goal setting. This could be done through OKRs (Objectives and
Key Results1) or any other methodology, so long as clarity was in place
regarding what was being done, and how it related to larger strategies.
    Our questions when arriving at InsureCo were similar. We needed to
understand why value wasn’t being realized, and to what extent that was due to
a lack of transparency (or, in some cases, over-transparency leading to confused
strategic intent). To what extent was this affecting business understanding?
Were teams sharing information and collaborating appropriately, or was silo
thinking the law of the land?
    We explored, knocked on doors, gathered data, and found some interesting
patterns. One piece of feedback that consistently cropped up across InsureCo
was that collaboration was far lower than they would’ve liked. The systems in
place necessary for collaboration were foggy and poorly designed, limiting the
flow of work between teams. This was, we discovered, an inherited feature of
the system rather than an emergent aspect. In essence, prior leadership had
created these barriers by design. But why? It’s likely that these barriers evolved
to solve different problems in a different time, but the data on delivery and
performance proved that things needed to change. We needed cross-domain
execution to create a fresh, coherent strategy. In fact, the nature of what needed
to be changed, the change demand, required coordination between what were
supposed to be independent domains. This meant increased collaboration and
an organization that better understood itself.
    Increased collaboration was also a priority at GovCo. We soon found a key
obstacle to achieving this related to transparency: the opaqueness of key
documentation.
    Prior to our arrival, teams kept their documentation close to their chests.
The status of projects was cloudy. At best, other teams or silos could tell
whether projects outside their purview were green, amber, or red. This made it
difficult to understand which initiatives were dependent upon others, which
outcomes were in stasis pending certain data, and so on.
    We decided to focus on visualization over documentation. We pressed for
teams to convert or refactor complex documents, processes, and data into
immediately accessible formats. This had the effect of democratizing key
information and making it clearer to all how capabilities were connected i.e.
which projects would provide which benefits to which teams. It also shifted
leadership thinking from project completion to a more nuanced understanding
of growth. They began asking, what capability do we have today that we didn’t
have yesterday? How do these visualizations demonstrate an unblocking of
processes or a maturation of our pipelines?
    Those on the executive level found this new approach refreshing. Instead of
being forced to sit through meetings and absorb Gantt chart after Gantt chart,
they could quickly and easily understand overall progress on a more relevant,
human level. It also helped that they were no longer engaging with “garbage”
data. Transparency did not mean sharing everything. Instead, with the focus on
value creation, the process of data sharing accelerated.
    At the time we concluded our engagement with GovCo, we had yet to see a
significant business benefit that could be directly credited to this change in
how data was visualized and shared. What was more apparent was a change in
focus away from traditional metrics and lagging measures like ROI, and
towards capabilities and enablement.
    Visualization over documentation and the democratization of key, relevant
data harkens back to the creation of an Obeya. Bringing people, data, and
ideas together into a single space to improve transparency and communication
is a parallel process to making that data legible and accessible. At Remote:af,
we spent considerable time developing the concept and function of a Virtual
Obeya, applying much of what we learned to our time at both GovCo and
InsureCo.
    What we quickly learned from applying these theories in practice was that
the creation of a Virtual Obeya was not just a nice-to-have, but a necessity. In
fact, we would argue it is impossible to operate remote Agile Governance
without a Virtual Obeya.
    Allow us to go one step further. Given the hybrid world we are now living
in, where many knowledge workers are privileged to be able to work from
home for a large portion of their time, we posit that all teams now need a
Virtual Obeya of some kind. The shift from obscure documentation to
accessible visualization at GovCo would have been a half-measure if we hadn’t
also enabled the creation of a space where those visualizations could be shared,
discussed, debated, and acted upon. So, too, for InsureCo—creating cross-
domain execution required a digital space for cross-domain interaction,
communication, collaboration, and partnership.
    Building this space at InsureCo allowed us to bring people, processes and
data together, which in turn allowed us to examine their sensible transparency
through the lens of the flow of work. We asked: how visible is their work,
really? We were concerned that, without the ability to quickly understand the
status of initiatives or change vehicles inside the system, it would be difficult
for leaders and teams to prioritize effectively.
    We soon discovered that InsureCo was doing some things right. They had
good foundational capabilities in place, but with varying levels of adoption and
maturity. What this means in practice was that some parts of the organization
were working very effectively, using modern workflow management tools to
make their work highly visible and transparent. Others were using plans and
processes developed in PowerPoint or tracking progress in private excel sheets.
    It was critical to get these teams aligned on their methods of visibility, and
fast. It was impossible to identify how work moved through the system unless
everyone was sharing their flows and constraints in the same manner. We got
the teams working to the same methods and using the same tools, then used
that information to clarify bottlenecks in the work and identify areas in need
of elevation.
    Getting all the teams working with the same workflow system and work
decomposition approach exposed another imbalance in the system. What we
observed was that, when one part of the business added demand that
outstripped supply, the actual delivery of change became inequitably
distributed. Demand created constraints, which acted as a tourniquet around
both delivery and change. What we did to address this was to map flow around
the organization and create a clear infographic that exposed where change was
happening, and why it was being forcibly limited in other areas. Creating clear
links between the constraints, the change, and the impacts of those limitations
helped tell a story about the importance of the change: why we were proposing
it, what it would achieve, and how it could be done.
    We should note that these maps were a select subset of data—the most
relevant data, and the most likely to create value. Not all data was shared
during this process. The same occurred during our time at GovCo as part of
the shift towards visualization. We wanted to increase sharing, but what we
termed “garbage” data was excluded, to allow a tighter focus on relevant
information regarding capabilities and enablement.
    This comes with a corollary: there isn’t really such a thing as garbage data.
All data is useful somewhere and to someone. We simply encouraged
executives, leadership, and teams to bring capabilities and outcome-centric
data to the forefront.
    However, by excluding or minimizing some forms of data, we ran the risk
of damaging trust. It’s critical to understand that if you tell teams you’re
excluding certain data for an important reason, they’ll generally believe and
agree with your decision. If you simply refuse to share it, then their confidence
will be shaken.
    That’s why we recommend that (as we did during our engagement at
GovCo) if data must be restricted or excluded for any reason, the thinking
behind that decision be articulated. In our case, it was because we had spoken
with stakeholders and understood what data mattered most to them:
capabilities, outcomes, and maturation. Had they asked for return on
investment, we may have approached the data differently.
    When this need is properly articulated, thinking amongst teams and
leadership evolves as well. When data on the growth of capabilities and
business benefits becomes transparent, the conversation among steering
committees changes as well. Governance and strategy adapt to suit, and the
entire organization will, over time, organically shift to focus on more valuable
metrics.
    Strategy was also a concern during our time at InsureCo. We went hunting
for strategy… At least, we tried to. The problem was, we couldn’t find it. What
little strategy existed wasn’t being adequately decomposed across the teams,
which meant leaders struggled to establish clarity of focus. In fact, there were
multiple strategies, all adding to the confusion and the fog of business.
    To improve this, we drew upon our work at Remote:af developing the
stanchion of Sensible Transparency. We found there was a clear link between
achieving transparency of progress, dependencies, and impediments, and the
length, quality, and dynamism of planning and strategy. To summarize, short-
cycle planning enables transparency, while quarterly, big-room planning
impedes it. The more remote the organization, the more critical it is to utilize
short-cycle planning in order to enable transparency and adaptability. Short-
cycle planning also helps organizations mimic the cadence of real-world events,
which require strategic adaptation on an ever-accelerating basis. Major change
is occurring in our world every three to four months—if planning and strategy
can’t keep pace, an organization will falter.
    We took this into practice at InsureCo and used a Virtual Obeya to draw
both people and information into a space where planning and strategy could
accelerate. Since then, large changes have been put into place. A single,
unifying strategy has been established, guiding the teams and prioritization of
work. This also allowed for the creation of a well-planned three-year roadmap
to scaffold and support short-cycle planning, increasing the clarity around
strategic decisions. These changes have allowed for huge improvements in how
the organization prioritizes and aligns people and resources. As a result, the
teams are now able to get greater value out of their limited capacity.
    To wrap up, we have some final observations and commonalities across
these case studies related to the stanchion of Sensible Transparency. These two
specific actions have huge potential to improve transparency of work and
enable better decision-making.

      1. Adopt standardized workflow tooling. Specifically, we asked every
      team at InsureCo, involved in change delivery, to run and manage that
      change through the same workflow management application. In the case
      of InsureCo, this involved the co-creation of workflow states, the
      decomposition of the process throughout the organization, and then the
      migration of over seventy delivery teams from old practices to new. The
      result was work visibility increasing from as low as 5% to as high as
      30% in the space of a few months, with more improvements coming
      down the pipeline, and within a year getting closer to 70%. Getting
      core teams established with the same workflow management application
      has also allowed us to switch focus towards more intensive adoption and
      optimization, as well as further connection across the delivery value
      chain. This allows us to trace our work at any point in the system, and
      to have the work visible to any team or leader.
      2. Adopt digital whiteboarding for communication and clarity. This
      practice emerged during lockdown and has exploded from the bottom-
      up due to its wide applicability and ease of use. The utility of the
      whiteboard application (in our case, Miro) has been proven many times
      over, at both InsureCo and GovCO, to the extent that they are now
      onboarding it as a standard Enterprise tool. They’re also looking for
      ways to integrate it into the workflow management applications. This,
      coupled with the advent and integration of work-accelerating AI tools,
      has helped to support and scaffold the creation of work within the
      system.

    Combined, all the processes, tools and ways of thinking discussed in this
chapter have worked to improve Sensible Transparency in the real world,
strengthening one of the five stanchions.
    If your next question is, “How do I dig into Sensible Transparency in my
own company?”, we have five key exercises to get you started.

      1. Canvas the system: Always start from where you are. It’s a common
      truism in kanban adoption that you start with where the work and what
      the flow of the work is today, and you mature from there. It’s always
      been that you commence work with an understanding of the current
      state, the as is. Get to know how the organization works and develop
      that starting position.
      2. Find the data: One thing that most modern organizations are not
      sure of is the data. The challenge is both finding it and making it useful
      enough to support decision-making in a timely manner. Find the people
      in your organization who are focused on performance and have a
      passion for finding and using data; they are always there somewhere and
      their nuggets of insight will help craft the whole. Gather as much
      relevant information as possible to craft your starting points. You also
      need to make decisions on how much transparency is the right amount.
      Transparency comes with a cost; nothing can be fully open without
      losing value. Put the limits in place.
      3. Agree on the tooling: It’s not much use having access to the
      information for decision-making if people can’t find or maintain it. Pick
      the right presentation layers for your organization so that you can create
      meaningful, accessible dashboards for reporting and decision-making.
      Stabilize that across the organization.
      4. Elevate the information: This is where tools such as Virtual Obeya,
      Power BI, and the like used for visualization, come into their own. Start
      putting out information and using it when talking to the work. You can
      get stuck in analysis paralysis forever. There needs to be a point where
      you have enough confidence that your information is directionally
      correct—if not 100% perfect—and enough to drive conversations.
      Often, your data will challenge opinions and perspectives, sometimes
      power bases and control, so the sooner you start doing that, the faster
      your transformation will be. Don’t be afraid to move forward, take the
      feedback and adjust—often it requires just a little bravery and
      challenging the status quo.
      5. Improve: The world doesn’t stand still and neither does your
      information—the way you gather it, or the best way to present it. Any
      system depreciates over time, it entrophies, unless you constantly
      inspect and adapt and introduce new energy and things. You need to
      implement the mechanisms supporting and enabling constant
      improvement and refinement, as well as data quality and governance, or
      the usability of your information will degrade. This need to reflect and
      improve is the core of agility and often gets forgotten.

   The key in a VUCA world is speed of information flow, which allows speed
of decision-making and response time. The old world, where people often used
information to create control and power, essentially to survive within particular
environments, is no longer practical at the pace of the world today. The days of
intrigue and gossip mongering at court are long gone. By opening up your
information, where it’s practical and legal to do so, you empower people to
focus on the right information, which allows for better decision-making in the
long run. It’s a key pillar of how you better govern your work.
12.3 Patterns of Work in the Real World
When we developed and implemented key findings from the Patterns of Work
stanchion across these three clients, we found a number of similarities that
strengthened our theories and helped flesh out what it meant to create strong
Patterns of Work in remote, asynchronous environments.
    We began with GovCo, where observing and understanding patterns of
work was critical. We had been asked to help their teams develop and evolve
their ways of working, and their leadership—as well as the Government body
—needed assurance that the newly adopted ways of working would still meet
standards and expectations, providing the public with the same, or better,
quality of outcome that they were used to. Public Service is generally held to a
more controlled approach to project execution than many private sector
organizations.
    The teams at the center of the transformation had already made use of the
Organizations Change Model. Their personal, bespoke model was well
documented, and included clear information on what was required to
transition between different working states. The leadership group had
specifically crafted a pattern of work that not only allowed for successful
application of their objectives but could meet public service standards.
    This had helped them to establish an operating rhythm that was effective
inside their own team, but it was having unexpected impacts on other teams
throughout the organization. This was partly due to unaligned working
practices and cadences, which further impacted business operations. In
addition, it created noise in the system thanks to an emergent “us versus them”
culture that needed to be remediated. This is also a pattern we see a lot—where
the “new” ways of the working team are challenging the system and doing
things differently, getting more attention from the organization.
    Understanding patterns of work was no less critical at InsureCo. If we
wanted to understand how their work was executed, we needed to examine and
understand the pattern in which work flowed from the idea holder to the idea
executor, as well as how long that took. Conceptualizing that entire process
was key… although, it’s more accurate to say processes, plural. Everything is a
process in the modern work environment. This is another core to agility that
gets forgotten or dismissed—the need to create clarity of your ways of working
as a process that you can work to, and also develop interactions with others.
    Some processes are large while some are extremely brief. Some processes are
clearly defined and managed, they are consistent and repeatable. They are
executed without drama. These are ideal homes for things such as robotic
process automation. Other processes are more unclear, emergent, and volatile.
These inconsistencies are often a reaction to the work being done and can’t
necessarily be ironed out of the process. What we can do is build transparency
into the system and map out the flow of those processes, so that the
inconsistencies and volatilities are anticipated and understood to the highest
degree possible. This also acknowledges that, as scenarios change, so do the
processes that require execution. Therefore, as change in process is constant,
the adaptability of the system must match.
    Teasing out which processes were which was our first step at InsureCo. We
did so by undertaking an exercise where we worked through almost thirty
different change-adjacent teams and domains, mapping out their flow of work.
What we found was that nearly thirty different value streams had been defined
to move work from the backlog to done. Some of those streams were well-
defined and meticulously planned, with continuous improvement as a key part
of their thinking. While others were a collection of post-its where people
mapped out what they thought they were achieving from day to day. These
teams naturally had inconsistent processes and weren’t really following the
procedures required to achieve positive change. And often we found a defined
process that wasn’t actually what teams were doing!
    Our observations corresponded with what we’d heard from teams and
leaders within the system: that inconsistency and lack of clarity was making it
hard to get things done, especially trying to achieve an outcome that spanned
systems and domains and included incongruous ways of working.
    So, how could we create consistency?
    For this, we turned to our work with Remote:af. The Remote Agility
Framework considers Patterns of Work through the lens of Systems. In our
time at Remote:af, we considered how a broad move to remote ways of
working turned effective digital environments and systems from nice-to-haves
into necessities for workplace success. None of this sounds radical with the
lockdown years well behind us, but at the time, getting a handle on these
concepts was the emergent problem most urgently in need of solving.
    What we determined was that the exact tools mattered less than finding
systems that enabled the operation of effective virtual workplaces. Virtual
collaborative tools, whiteboards, conferencing and sharing were all essential,
but what was critical was considering how well these enabled and supported
patterns of work in the new paradigm rather than trying to replicate the
physical, in-person experience.
   It’s no surprise that some of the largest growth in the technology sector
during the pandemic years was amongst organizations that provided remote
work equipment and solutions: Miro, Slack, Atlassian, AWS, Microsoft, and so
on. As they say, the secret to getting rich in a gold rush is selling picks to the
miners.
   We took our learnings regarding tools and systems from Remote:af and
used them to fuel improvements at InsureCo. We asked, what digital
environments and systems are critical here? Which tools suit existing ways of
working, and which will elevate processes? What fundamental changes to
teams could support this push towards consistency?
   We’ll return to InsureCo in a moment and discuss what changes were
implemented. First, we’d like to briefly discuss how consistency, and codified
ways of working, were also critical at GovCo. We needed to work with teams
inside this client organization to examine their ways of working, and ensure
they were codified in a clear, accessible manner that gave team employees
confidence and an ultimate source of truth to refer to when things got foggy.
We asked whether work had been documented in a single place managed by
the teams, for example: Jira, Confluence, or Github.
   We also considered how work was broken down. Was there a standardized
breakdown structure in place that was followed across the board in a
disciplined manner, or was it more ad hoc? If the latter, how could we assist in
codifying those breakdown structures? This extended to Epics and Stories: did
they have defined structures and naming conventions? Where could friction
points be eased by making everything a little more structured?
   Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) also fell under
the umbrella of ways of working. Did teams have full use of CI/CD
automation, including testing with stated coverage? When tests took place,
were there automated tests in place with clearly stated coverage of base code? If
not, why? We also considered inter-team and cross-team communication. Was
there a single, agreed-upon method of communicating between dependent
teams? If not, could we help establish one? In addition, did teams share a
single, well-developed, up-to-date roadmap that encompassed the evolution of
the product?
   We left GovCo to sit with these questions and find solutions that brought
teams together with unified, coherent, consistent Patterns of Work, rather than
piecemeal, team-by-team solutions.
   Returning to our engagement with InsureCo, we needed to get a little more
hands-on. To solve the problems we observed within the Patterns of Work
stanchion, we constructed two key activities:

      1. To create more enduring teams and move away from project centered
      approaches that traditionally take people to new work, rather than take
      work to stable teams. This means designing and implementing around
      the principles of flow, as well as creating observable designs, processes,
      and patterns that allow multiple teams to connect and sync into a team
      of teams. This allows them to connect into problems to be solved. At
      InsureCo, the first of these long-lived teams has been designed and
      launched. Others are going through ideation now. We use a consistent
      approach to design and launch these teams, which allows us to align
      future teams on ways of working and replicable patterns. Much of this
      work was based upon the foundation provided by the Remote Agility
      Framework, although we have made tweaks and adjustments where
      necessary to suit the constraints of the organization.
      2. To create opportunities for more aligned ways of working and
      practices by standardizing the workflow management application
      adoption for workflow traceability. Yes, we know that these methods
      have limits upon the number of permitted workflow states and items.
      This, in turn, puts constraints on teams. However, the teams are then
      left to decide how to work at their own discretion, using these
      constraints as enabling boundaries. What follows is greater alignment
      across teams regarding patterns and practices. The result is that when
      people move between teams, they’re shifting into familiar environments.
      Dependencies are also clearer, work is more traceable end-to-end, and
      capabilities are uplifted. In short, standardization of DevOps gives
      workers power and flexibility, and uplifts collaboration in multi-
      domain, complex, and complicated problems. This can often be a
      challenge in a fragmented organization as every team’s scenario is
       unique, like a snowflake. Yet this is a critical step to digitizing clarity of
       work.

    These two smaller goals fed into our larger goal: to help InsureCo create and
maintain a level of alignment and consistency within the Patterns of Work
stanchion. Every function within this stanchion needed to be clear as to the
way it worked and operated, so that when projects and work spanned
boundaries or teams, there were strong anchors in place that teams could use as
a foundation for communication and collaboration. Small limitations imposed
at the team level created an abundance of flexibility at the Strategic Enterprise
level.
    One could argue the merits of this trade-off. In some organizations of
different sizes and structures, this might not be the right call for their Patterns
of Work. For our client, it was exactly what they needed. None of their teams
were islands and were driven largely by the architecture of their software
systems (as we so often see, communication channels driving solutions—
thanks again Conway)2. They had to internalize and be guided by that
knowledge.
    All our efforts creating consistency are supported by the work we did at
Remote:af, which reinforced how crucial it is to codify how work is done…
particularly when it is being done asynchronously. That was where the strength
of the Remote Agility Framework demonstrated itself, especially with the
stanchions of Agile Governance as a core, stabilizing anchor. When we say
codification, we mean workflow design, such as value stream management and
mapping.
    What we found interesting in our time with Remote:af was that, when
speaking with multiple partner companies, we found that this codification
process was generally recognized as important—even in the context of onsite
teams—but it wasn’t being done nearly enough. Especially when it came to
onsite teams. It was only with the forcible move to remote work that many
organizations had the catalyst to accelerate activities like using value stream
mapping to define flows of work. As we’ve seen many times before, sometimes
good ideas require a nudge before they find their footing. As a result of so
many organizations diving into these processes, we now consider value stream
mapping, and similar activities, mandatory in any team aiming to deliver
collaboratively.
    Consistent Patterns of Work at both GovCo and InsureCo were key to their
success. However, the journey towards excellence at GovCo wasn’t quite done.
When we concluded our engagement, their teams and leaders had a number of
questions to explore internally, and to use as springboards for further growth.
    For example, we examined ways of working as they pertained to customer
interactions. Did developers and testers alike interact directly with the
customer, both in relation to User Acceptance Testing and Post Verification
Testing? When they developed the user experience, were they working side by
side with the customer? Were they giving that user experience the focus it
deserved?
    We engaged in Systems Reflection: the process of examining the system as a
whole and understanding how it works, why it works, and what dysfunctions
may arise over time as a result of the shape or function of the system. When we
engaged with GovCo, we asked questions like: is there evidence of strong
technical engineering practices and tooling? Do these practices provide a
proper foundation for agility, and do they work to increase the quality and
reduce the risk of releases? Are software release practices tight and working to a
consistent cadence? In addition, who owns those practices? Was ownership
concentrated in a single team, or role, or did they have joint ownership across
the technical and business arms of the organization?
    We also asked how employees were contracted in their current positions.
Are they permanent employees? Part time? Contracted? Consultants? And so
on. We needed to know if a majority of the teams, particularly those in key
roles, were permanent employees. This impacts who holds the inherent IP of
the system, and the stability of systems long-term. Overweighting to
contingent or consulting type engagements leads to loss of IP and long-term
indirect cost, yet alone being more expensive generally.
    Leaders at GovCo used the work we initiated to build upon these questions
after we concluded our engagement.
    Of all the questions we left GovCo to consider, the cadence of delivery was
one of the most important. Our work at Remote:af demonstrated that delivery
and planning is performed in increasingly shorter cadences—even shorter than
the rapid cadences many traditional Agilists are used to—in order to enable
expedient adaptation and decisioning. This is a necessary move in situations
where the domain is constantly shifting and VUCA is at work inside and out.
All teams run the risk of making mistakes or bad decisions, but by empowering
remote teams to build bespoke, highly efficient patterns of work, they run the
risk of building upon bad decision after bad decision and ending up off track
long before the misalignment is noticed.
    Instead, all evidence now points to the benefits of shortening cadences and
ensuring that alignment to the global strategy is a part of every cadence. This
allows remote teams to confirm the right priorities are being worked on,
without time lag increasing risk and cost of delay in the unfortunate scenario
that they’re headed down the wrong path.
    As a result of these learnings, we’ve prioritized the increased cadence of
delivery and planning for future engagements, and as a core component of the
Patterns of Work stanchion.
    When you’re first looking into Patterns of Work inside your own
organization, there are countless ways to begin. Our top five recommendations
for getting started are:

      1. Map the current flow: The start point is knowing how work gets to
      done in your system today. There are a variety of approaches or methods
      that can be used to achieve this—Value Stream Mapping, SIPOC
      mapping, Systems Thinking Approach for Implementing Kanban, and
      so on. Gather all current known process flows, synthesize them, and
      create the most meaningful representation of how work moves from
      idea to done—the life cycle of change. It’s always critical to capture as
      much of the current way of working as possible to baseline the future.
      Respect what is already there, and the work done by others, to optimize
      and improve. The fastest path to failure is trying to design external to
      the system and then forcing that new way of working onto your teams.
      By mapping the current state, you bring people along on the journey of
      change by visualizing issues in their current workflow and removing
      opinion.
      2. Select constraints and design new patterns: There are constraints in
      any system of work, some are enabling and some preventative, some you
      can challenge, and some can’t be changed. Clarifying what these are, and
      their nature, will allow you to tackle the problems that can be solved.
      Elevate them to leadership so that they know what you’re going after
      and can support by removing impediments to change. There is no point
designing a future state operating model and flow of work if there are
immovable constraints that prevent the model from being successful.
You can then use these as core principles for designing the new patterns
of work. Ensure your proposed design has multiple approaches and
patterns for different problem domains, as you need to allow for
variability where teams are solving different things in different contexts.
Pick the common pillars and make them fixed, enabling constraints,
and be clear on what can be variable.
3. Pick the domains and problems to prioritize: Now that you have
your patterns of work you need to pick the domains or areas to
prioritize. Don’t try to tackle the whole organization, pick the areas
where you can challenge the system and have willing teams to work
with. You might find this referred to as a Coalition of the Willing…
rather than cooperation of the impacted. You also want to find one that
has enough complexity to it because if you pick a simple area to tackle
then you might not learn enough to be successful. It often works best to
start with two or three specific areas and move them forward in parallel.
After all, being able to demonstrate progress remains vital to continued
support for any change efforts.
4. Develop the change plan and transition teams incrementally and
safely: Ensure that you have a strong change management plan that
supports the outcome, and the steps people need to take to get there.
You also need to ensure that the teams you’re working with are able to
dedicate capacity to shift their way of working, otherwise this becomes
an “and” to their day job. One of the most important things a team
should do is design and improve their ways of working. We often don’t
give them the space to do this. After all, if you’re not improving
processes then you’re actually going backwards as the system progresses
around you. Then you end up needing large-scale transformation
because you haven’t kept pace.
5. Reflect and improve: The last key element is ensuring that you learn
from the process of transformation and transition, adapting your
approach so it is always relevant and improving. This extends to the
teams: giving them the space, tooling, capacity, and capability to
       improve their own ways of working. Give them the guide rails and
       ability to decide the how, which will promote ownership and ensure
       continuous improvement towards maintaining productivity. Many
       agilists will forget that being human centric and moving Patterns of
       Work towards being more agile will create a more empowered
       Workforce but still needs to be productive and efficient. Part of
       reflecting on the work means constantly demonstrating that the system
       is getting better.

   The way teams work is fundamental to not just governing the system, but
getting the best out of our agile teams. We often hear the throwaway line that
an organization’s ways of working are not fit for purpose, but it’s rare to find
the corresponding approaches and solutions being enabled to solve for that.
Many organizations are also provided glossy proposals by consultancies that
suggest changing the ways of working is all that is needed to solve all an
organization’s problems. Both approaches are incorrect. Finding the right ways
of working for your organization is critical, yet they also need to be reflective of
the system today and the environment in which work happens. The best
outcome is to design collaboratively, purposely, and consistently, and enable
your teams to take as much of that responsibility as you can safely delegate
within the clear constraints you need to maintain.
12.4 Data-Driven Reasoning in the Real World
The foundation of the Data-Driven Reasoning stanchion is formed from
metrics and measuring. Whether it was in our work with GovCo, InsureCo, or
our work with Remote:af developing the pillars of Remote Governance,
everything began with and revolved around the collection and analysis of
relevant metrics. When we began our work with GovCo, we knew we had to
completely understand how they gathered their metrics and measures, and how
they used that information, if we wanted to help them improve the use of data
in their governance. We started by asking questions of leaders and teams, such
as: what are the standard metrics and measures being used inside this system?
Are standard agile metrics like committed vs delivered, velocity, cumulative
flow, and sprint goals being effectively employed? Are flow-based metrics used
to measure the lead, cycle, and wait times of work progressing through the
system?
    Just as important to the collection of metrics was how they were being used.
Were those metrics being used to baseline and improve teams, and if so, then
how? We investigated whether these metrics were utilized for real-time
reporting. Was there transparency of real-time progress across areas such as
dependencies, risks, issues, impediments, and initiatives?
    The information we gathered provided several potential outcomes to
leadership, as well as various stakeholders, participants in the system of work,
and the teams themselves. The primary outcome was to validate that the teams
were using well-defined practice to gather data and using that to inform
decision-making. As these teams were each using bespoke ways of working,
they were producing unique data that couldn’t be measured against any single,
central Gantt Chart or Excel spreadsheet. As such, teams were individually
validating that they were using the right data, in the right way, at the right
time, and for the right decisions. Thankfully, those teams rose to the challenge
and demonstrated this handily. Another key outcome from the questions and
review was that other participants now trusted the system to deliver to the
change demand, and that they could now better align dependencies across a
wide variety of teams.
    We didn’t have to hunt for data quite so hard when we began working with
InsureCo. In fact, when we walked through their doors and started talking
about the stanchion of Data-Driven Reasoning, they assured us that they loved
data. Loved it.
    Here’s the thing: every organization says that they love data and make data-
driven decisions. And that’s probably true for financial decisions. Maybe even
investment and customer directional decisions too. But the claim gets wobbly
when we move to other areas. For example, how often do you hear of data
being used for decisions related to internal performance measures? Sometimes.
Not nearly as often as finance, where we tend to overweight data for reporting
and underweight it for tactical and strategic management decisions.
    When we commenced our work with InsureCo, we were assured that the
workflow was improving. Speeding up, in fact. But we needed to verify this to
make sure we were getting the right data to answer the right questions. We
started by hunting for data on how the system was performing at that time,
versus where they wanted the system to eventually be. We also needed that
data to properly understand what to measure improvement against.
    We quickly discovered that the client had already made some positive
progress. Valuable work had gone into trying to manage the flow of initiatives
at a basic level. This served as a useful launchpad for understanding the system
as a whole and any preconceptions around how the system functioned (or
failed to function). This overview of initiatives included a manually operated
Change Backlog that was standalone from the larger system and being
managed by private individuals. Even so, it provided fascinating insights into
core elements including lead time, throughput, wait times, and delays.
    We quickly learned that, counter to the narrative that everything was going
smoothly, processes were not functioning as intended. Lead times were well
above industry averages, and getting worse as more demand was being placed
on the system. More work was coming in, and less was getting out. This was
both perceived and felt, but not agreed to or elevated.
    It was an interesting lesson in the usefulness of data that could otherwise be
overlooked. The source of the data wasn’t pristine, or completely reliable, but
in aggregate it demonstrated important trends validating our theory that work
was slowing down, rather than speeding up. These insights provided a baseline
of information for the remainder of the work that we both measured and
improved against.
    As always, data trumped opinion. That observation has been proven true
time and time again, and our work at Remote:af only reinforced this. For
clarity, the stanchion of Data-Driven Reasoning is paralleled by the
Information pillar in the Remote Agility Framework. As we worked with
Remote:af to develop the concepts that would become their pillars and our
stanchions, we quickly learned it was essential to ensure systems inside
organizations were being reflected digitally, and that they were generating
sufficient data to make informed decisions. Without this data being created,
shared, and consumed via a Virtual Obeya, it was near impossible to enable
effective leadership and cross-organizational transparency, meaning opinion
would usually take precedence over data.
    It was readily apparent to us that some of the most important information
was team and individual health metrics, which provided insights into their
well-being. With the switch to remote ways of working, these became even
more important, as leaders were missing out on the traditional water-cooler
chats and checkups. However, many high-performing teams in surveyed
organizations had already reached similar conclusions organically; they knew
the value of maintaining a lens into their internal performance and team
health. Many other organizations, though, are only now crossing the chasm3
(to borrow a phrase from Geoffrey Moore) and seeking deeper insights into
team health.
    We see this all too often. We’ve visited so many organizations that talk
about being data-led and data-driven, with a plethora of KPIs and targets to
present, but flounder once we dig deeper. It’s disappointing discovering that an
organization is ignorant to its own flow and performance, outside of any data
not directly related to financials. It’s rare to work with an organization that
doesn’t care in some way for team health—but as per Deming,4 they can’t
improve what they can’t measure.
    In some cases, the introduction of data-driven decisioning is not easily
accepted due to the learned behaviors and culture of the organization having
served them well in traditional delivery. The introduction of data-driven
decisioning is sometimes difficult to embrace. One such instance involved the
introduction of agility within GovCo where agile processes and governance
methods brought about new techniques for the production, sourcing, and
consumption of data. Additionally, it brought contention.
    Real-time data rollups were built by the agile program to facilitate quick
decision-making. Workflow data was used to demonstrate progress and
highlight dependencies, risks, and roadblocks. This was extended to the point
of developing real-time dashboards that displayed metrics for success,
construction information, and defect resolution.
    GovCo challenged the traditional methods of governance used for reporting
and approval, such as document trails, signoffs, and registers. A good example
is that, like many organizations, progress toward delivering the software
required a visit to the Change Advisory Board (CAB) (along with a plethora of
signed and sealed documents). The CAB operated on a quarterly delivery cycle,
as most releases in the organization followed a very traditional waterfall cycle.
    This group had established CICD pipelines and practices (continuous
integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment), as well as a very
strong automated testing program. They used this capability to deliver to
internal environments. However, while their business representatives had been
brought along and were familiar with the new reporting dashboards, this did
not extend to production, or a shortening of the delivery timelines for
production.
    After we’d spent some time working with GovCo, we suggested that the
digital reporting and release dashboards be incorporated into the governance
cycle, replacing the paper trails while allowing for discussions and enquiries
about quality and due diligence. It was deemed acceptable to lower the release
cycle to monthly and make digital sign-off against any variations to the norm.
    The key factor here was not just challenging the current process head-on. It
was education, which in turn provided data to promote understanding and
recognition that expedient and accurate decisions could be made using the new
methods. This also ensured that audit, risk, and compliance information was
included for a release cycle to ensure that it fell within their risk tolerance,
while still enabling teams to deliver faster.
    Something we found interesting while developing the Data-Driven
Reasoning stanchion at InsureCo was that the elevation and transparency of
data had the potential to create contention and conflict. There was a
misconception that some parts of the delivery system that had been over-
invested in were actually performing to expectations, even though all the
evidence found in lead time and quality-type metrics contradicted that
assumption.
    Some key areas were also reluctant to embrace the data of workflow and
performance, preferring to focus on traditional metrics. Although there was a
desire to gather and publish data that would be accessible for all, there was a
developed behavior (perhaps even an internal culture) where any information
that could be perceived as negative would be held back until the message could
be managed. This practice clashes with our fast-paced, data-driven world. The
problem to be solved moves too quickly, and the ramifications of a lack of
transparency are increasingly profound.
   More system conflict was caused by the visualization of demand exceeding
supply and that by constantly starting work we were in fact slowing down
outputs. The decision to begin “stopping” work had far-reaching consequences
with the potential to impact outcomes and plans made the year before. The
fact was that the entire concept of twelve-month fixed plans is outdated in a
VUCA world. And this lack of planning flexibility played out when trying to
control Work In Progress by not starting on new work until everything in
progress was finished. The temporary pain of stopping unnecessary work and
adjusting outdated plans was critical to getting this system conflict under
control. Finally, the elevation of KPIs when using data (especially where those
KPIs don’t align across functions) caused further conflict, creating an
environment where competition was the order of the day for scarce resources.
We needed to turn that conflict into collaboration, and alignment on data-
driven decisioning was the answer.
   We mentioned previously that data can be a double-edged sword (see
Chapter 9, Data-Driven Reasoning). Here, this was proven true… at least, in
the early months of our engagement. It took more than six months for the data
to actually become understood, and for people to trust that data when it came
time to make critical decisions.
   Perhaps part of what finally helped them adjust to and accept the reality of
data-driven decisioning was the realization that, just as the data suggested, too
much work was being put through the system, and delivery was suffering as a
result. This forced leadership to direct their teams to focus and prioritize. It
took data to help them realize that they couldn’t achieve everything all at once.
   There were three key actions we took during this engagement to help
establish the case for a switch to a data-driven perspective. These were:

      1. To improve, stabilize, and uplift the reliability of data sources. We
      knew we needed strong, accurate baselines to measure against, and to be
      using data for reliable decision-making. None of this could be achieved
      without trusting where the data was coming from. As such, we
      performed several ongoing sweeps of data sources, checking each
      element for reliability. We also invested heavily in data and reporting,
      beginning by using static outputs. Once those outputs were stabilized
      and reliable, we moved to using Power BI (the Microsoft Reporting
      suite). This allowed them to dynamically update their data against
      Power BI reports, providing a clear, accessible dashboard for our core
      system performance measures. With the dashboard functioning,
      everyone had visibility and could use those performance measures to
      improve efficiency and effectiveness.
      2. To create a reliable data source as part of the migration to a single
      workflow management application. By moving every team into a state
      where they consistently traced their work in a transparent fashion, we
      were able to move away from using manual dashboards, and towards a
      completely automated system that built coherent datasets straight from
      the source.
      3. To present our plans, methods, and achievements in as many places
      as possible. This meant talking constantly about the data we were
      collecting and the insights it provided. We began discussing it at an
      executive level during every quarterly performance review, with the goal
      of increasing the frequency to a six-week cadence. This isn’t just a local
      domain goal. We consider it a technology goal that will improve
      efficiency of delivery, as well as identify how much work moves through
      the system as compared to the first-year baselines.

   Evidence is that InsureCo using the agreed and baselined performance
measures had, over a six-month period, improved its overall measurable
productivity by 6.1%. This is the result of several change initiatives and
ongoing continuous improvement work across the system, but without taking
the stance that data matters and stabilizing it first, that would not be
demonstrable. Needless to say, the executive leadership were pleased with what
they were seeing.
   That being said, as we collected increasing amounts of data from Insureco
and, in concert with teams and leaders, converted that data into actionable
insights, we learned that some of our earlier observations and assumptions
were incorrect. This required us to pivot on some of the activities and mental
models we used as part of this engagement. We are human, and always going
through a journey of learning and improving. However, we’d rather start from
strong assumptions and then adapt as the data arrives than wait for a perfect
analysis and perfect solution that may never arrive. This reinforces the need to
consider Transformation as a series of options to be explored, reserving the
right to pivot based on feedback and learning. You can’t turn a ship if you’re
standing still.
    Data-Driven Reasoning allows for this type of approach. It reduces the time
spent designing the solution, creating more time for you to dive in and do the
work.
    As we write this book in mid-2023, Remote:af is now being used in
organizations across the globe. So too have we seen the adoption of the
Remote Governance pillars. We’ve already seen how effective this framework
can be for organizations standing on the front line of the battle against VUCA,
and we expect that as learnings continue to roll in, the pillars of Remote
Governance will continue to evolve. So too will the five stanchions of Agile
Governance. They are both ever-evolving frameworks that we believe will be
relevant and effective for decades to come.
    To begin building the Data-Driven Reasoning stanchion in your own
organization, we recommend you:

      1. Cast your gaze: Observe what is being used today, and how, and look
      for opportunities to scale rather than assume you must begin from a
      zero base. In other words, respect the system you have today and start
      from where you are. What are your outcomes and objectives, and how
      can they be achieved using what you already have at hand?
      2. Define your standards: Determine what you need to codify and what
      can be variable. Determine what system you will use, which are the
      right practices to adopt, where you should store these standards, and
      how. Do these as collaboratively as possible, and also be ready to move
      forward when there is enough alignment. Accessibility is key, as is ease
      of adoption. Keep cost in mind as you determine what will best enable
      people to work as efficiently and effectively as possible across the
      delivery ecosystem. Decisions must be made that will extend beyond the
      initial phase and far into the future.
      3. Support your change journey: Plan for transition and training, as well
      as supporting people to move to new systems, standards, and ways of
      working. Guides, tools, and coaching are important for success. The
      best endeavors are often not enough—you need to invest to ensure an
      outcome, or you’ll just get faster horses. Plan the change journey out,
      and communicate excessively.
      4. Baseline your reports: Once data is established, collected, and used,
      baseline it and create the reporting suite. Publish, communicate, and
      update often. Be visible early, accept that your processes will change and
      you will get things wrong, and be ready to learn from the process of
      failure through inspecting and adapting. Don’t set out to fail, of course.
      Set out to learn quickly and pivot. Building trust in the data is great,
      but you also want to build trust in the teams using it, as well as their
      belief that the data is fit for purpose. Lack of trust in the outputs is a
      killer in this phase of transition.
      5. Visualize, communicate, optimize, and improve: You must now put
      your money where your mouth is and actually use the data to drive your
      decision-making. Share it, talk about it, and tell stories about how it’s
      making a difference. Broadcast freely and enthusiastically, but not
      fanatically. You must still be honest about what your data is achieving
      and where it’s falling short, and you must always look to improve and
      optimize your processes.

   It’s interesting how many times we’ve gone into an organization that hasn’t
been able to provide or does not know its own performance data. Yet they will
gather and report on endless other KPIs and financial metrics and measures. If
you don’t know your system and you don’t know your work then you literally
can’t improve. At the same time, many of these organizations will have
amazing people, doing amazing things, trying to craft these insights. If you do
nothing else, find the people who are passionate about these things, help them,
and give them the platform to be successful. They will probably solve the data
questions for you!
12.5 Humanity as the Cornerstone in the Real World
This brings us to the last stanchion: Humanity.
    Before we dive into how we helped our three clients better understand how
Humanity could form the cornerstone of great governance, we’d like to first
revisit the Heart of Agile, which served as one of our guiding influences while
creating this stanchion.
    The Heart of Agile—Dr.Alistair Cockburn’s model for simplifying and
clarifying the most critical imperatives of agility—has been a significant
influence on all the Stanchions. It’s the Heart of Agile’s emphasis on people
that has most affected us during our years of working with Alistair as Heart of
Agile Guides. And we regularly use this to check or identify whether the work
we’re doing has the necessary human quotient.
    The Heart of Agile orients itself around attitudes and behaviors. It guides us
to focus on the fact that no matter what framework you use, collaboration (to
wit, humans working together) done well will improve information flow. That
flow improves decisions, specifically humans making decisions, and therefore
improves delivery. It ensures you remember to take the time to reflect and
improve, together, in order to enhance collaboration and delivery.
    The longer we worked with Alistair and the Heart of Agile, the clearer it
became that humanity was a central tenet of good governance. It couldn’t be a
nice-to-have appended on to the other stanchions; it needed a stanchion of its
own. By making this decision, we ensured that Agile Governance had a clear
humanistic focus as opposed to being consumed by the mechanistic processes
that traditional governance so ritualistically puts in place to control or
command. This mirrors what Heart of Agile teams set out to do. That ethos is
at the center of what we are trying to do.
    Many of our theories on implementing Humanity as the Cornerstone
remained theories until, much like the preceding four Stanchions, we had the
opportunity to implement our findings in our engagements. When we did so,
we found similarities that strengthened the model and helped flesh out our
understanding of what it meant to curate and create meaningful human
connections in remote, asynchronous environments. People are people, and
despite much of our business moving en masse to remote, many of the
challenges of the physical world continued to manifest in the digital (or, in
some cases, grow exponentially). As Andrew Blain from Remote:af would say,
“In remote contexts, silos become chasms”.
    So, let’s explore some of the questions we explored with those three clients,
and how they changed their lenses on Humanity as the Cornerstone of good
governance.
    First, let’s talk about GovCo. We began our engagement by peeling back the
lid on their internal culture to find out where things were working well, and
where they weren’t. This began with a dive into trust and transparency.
    We asked questions about safety, such as: did employees feel the
organization was psychologically safe; that they were able to raise issues or
share failures as learnings without fear of repercussion? In the same vein, was
trust evident inside teams or was there an undercurrent of blame running
throughout the internal culture?
    We also wanted to know whether teams had built trusted relationships both
internally and externally. Could people have candid conversations with other
employees outside of their immediate circles? If issues occurred, did they feel
able and safe in raising those issues with colleagues and leaders?
    Transparency also figured into our discussions on culture. We needed to
know whether transparency was broad or constrained. Was data and decision-
making transparent across teams or was it limited to within silos (and, as per
Andrew Blain, were those silos expanding into chasms)? Did that transparency
extend to metrics, especially metrics regarding how teams worked to deliver
targets and maintain flow?
    When we commenced our work with InsureCo, we took a similar
approach. The fundamentals were a bit different, of course. Their focus on
providing insurance meant that being people-first, and helping people live
better lives, was already a core driver of this organization. In fact, annual
engagement surveys demonstrated that employees did feel supported by their
organization.
    Did this extend to how InsureCo structured control of the work in delivery
teams? Unfortunately, not. It was by no means universal, but in some domains,
(even the more progressive ones) we discovered prescriptive governance that
treated people like cogs in a larger machine. Engagement was low, with teams
feeling disempowered and being viewed as feature factories. This was the result
of an intentional divide being opened between demand and supply, between
those who wanted the change and those who were actually able to make the
change. The final impact was overburdening, a lack of clarity, and challenges to
alignment in strategic outcomes, which had all evolved as a result of long-term
decisions, management policies, and interventions.
    To shift this system, we asked management to take a human-first approach
to redesigning their operating model. We provided each team domain with
tools that would help them design their ideal working and governance models,
and stayed hands-on to guide them through the process. This approach
leveraged the Remote:af model as well as the principles within the five
stanchions, while being contextualized to the existing systems within InsureCo.
We needed to ensure that any work done to change and evolve governance
models was done with an awareness of existing constraints that could inhibit
change, and to standardize data so that each team could clearly understand
how the system traced work from strategy to done.
    All of this required trust—not always easy to come by, we know! When in
doubt, we returned to Principle Five of the Manifesto:“Build projects around
motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and
trust them to get the job done.”
    We also asked, do we provide the space to collaboratively design their work?
Principle 8 states: “Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.”
    Those two principles were our guiding light with InsureCo. We supplied
guidance and the pattern to follow and then carved out the time to enable
teams to learn and design together. The people on the ground did the rest.
    But our time with InsureCo raised a question we just couldn’t shake: why,
exactly, do so many systems of governance seem to want to minimize or strip
away the humanity from their teams? We see Prudential Standards, Prudential
Guidelines, and Reporting Standards… and almost none of it is human-
centric! In fact, much of the Governance ecosystem eschews the carrot and
instead uses the regulatory or compliance stick based on those standards to
expedite or block work. This, in turn, creates unnecessary tension.
    Our experience spent using Humanity as the Cornerstone and a driver for
crafting Agile Governance has allowed us to turn this on its head, even in
heavily regulated industries. We’d often hear (in response to our proposals),
“Your ideas can’t work here because we are heavily regulated.” In these
instances, we responded with, “Regulated more than a nuclear submarine?”
We’d then provide the context of Turn the Ship Around5, where David
Marquet used principles similar to our stanchions to turn the Santa Fe Nuclear
Submarine from the worst to the best performing in the Navy. In these High
Reliability categorized organizations (HRO6), interactive complexity and tight
coupling can, theoretically, lead to a system accident—a failure more critical
than a simple loss of productivity, for example. Marquet achieved this through
strong organizational design, a culture focused on safety, clear management,
and the most critical factor of all: empowering the right people to make
decisions. If he could turn decades, if not centuries of traditional governance
on its head in a HRO without breaking regulations, why can’t others?
    When we talk about people making choices and decisions, and a culture of
governance that helps accelerate decision-making, there’s no example that
matches the Santa Fe Nuclear Submarine. We want to be clear that
transitioning to a human-centric system of governance doesn’t change the
fundamental goals of that system: the intent and the outcome. All we want to
do is accelerate the pace of critical decision-making. The reason for setting
practices and methods to control and report on work is also unchanged. What
we believe and work towards is changing the how and the what, and even then,
we’re not asking for a complete reinvention.
    This is in contrast to when a new leader arrives, recognizes problems in how
the current system is working, and (in the pursuit of increased efficiency and
effectiveness) chooses the most disruptive option. Go nuclear! Blow everything
up and let the pieces land where they may! This approach refuses to
acknowledge the current state of the existing system and presupposes that
everything is wrong and irredeemable. In some scenarios, this may be correct.
In many (most) others, work needs to commence with a more human-centric
approach. Before change commences, the existing system needs to be analyzed
so both good and bad can be identified. That means picking out the
constraints, the things that work and should be retained, and what aspects can
be leveraged for broader benefit and to accelerate change. This approach also
builds better human engagement, as it places the people within the system at
the heart of the change process.
    In a complex environment, when responding to VUCA, we often don’t
know in advance what the truly impactful activities are going to be. So, instead
of blowing everything up, preserve as many options as possible to the last
responsible moment7.
   Another option is greenfields—creating an all-new structure or system
alongside the existing system that can eventually be attached or subsumed into
the original. Or strangle the old, to borrow the “Strangler Pattern” metaphor
from Martin Fowler8: “...gradually create a new system around the edges of the
old, letting it grow slowly over several years until the old system is strangled.”
   However, building a new structure or system without awareness and
connectivity to the existing system creates more problems than it solves.
Setting up a tribe, putting in your own train lines, or whatever your flavor of
change vehicle, is often done in ignorance of the broader system and how real
change happens. As a result, the Law of Unintended Consequences9 (outcomes
of a purposeful action that are not intended or foreseen), comes into play,
although there’s enough evidence to demonstrate those outcomes are entirely
predictable and are repeated every time. Unintended, yes. Unpredictable? No.
   What’s critical to us is the essence of agility itself, about putting people first.
The Agile Manifesto was a moment in time designed to challenge systems of
work that hampered pro-knowledge work and pro-creative environments. We
must now expand upon the manifesto and find ways to include people in our
larger governance decisions. And not just the people within the newly
transformed ecosystem, but those in and around the system required to get
work done and value shipped.
   We observed the necessity of Humanity as the Cornerstone when working
with InsureCo. We quickly learned how important the psychosocial element of
transformation was. When people have been asked to operate in a certain way
for so long, and learned not to challenge the status quo, it takes a long time for
them to feel empowered enough to fully embrace the opportunity of change.
Even their leaders tended to defer to the current working model, refusing to
see the value of allowing humans to design how they want to work. Nothing to
see here, they insisted. Just copy the existing approach.
   We also saw a tendency amongst leaders where, post design decisions, they
would re-prosecute and push back against those decisions. The result was that
they lacked the trust of their teams. Of course, that’s okay if emergent data and
information not previously known casts new light on previous decisions. It’s
often leaders who receive the greatest breadth of information flow, as opposed
to people lower in the hierarchical system. But as far as we observed, that often
wasn’t the driver behind this behavior.
    Towards the end of our engagement with InsureCo, we found that feedback
from the teams taking part in the new design approach was as mixed as the
feedback from leaders. Some had dived into the challenge of creating change
and wanted to own the process. Some viewed it as getting in the way of work.
People are nonlinear and unpredictable. However, that unpredictability can
also be a strength, if leveraged correctly.
    As a public service entity rather than a private-sector organization, GovCo
already had a higher focus on people than the norm. However, in much the
same way as we’ve observed in the private sector, this often translated to the
leadership group but not all the way through to the people doing the work.
    In this case, the people working on the program had become engaged,
empowered, and passionate about their way of working. Yet this was
counterbalanced by frustration as the governing mechanisms of the
organization were at loggerheads with what they knew was working well, and
they didn’t have the capacity to solve this mismatch.
    The change program had enabled teams to be self-organizing, granting
individuals autonomy and ownership. It acknowledged their intelligence and
creativity, which fostered trust, respect, and empowerment. By encouraging
open communication and collaboration, they had created a sense of belonging
and shared purpose among team members. The vital aspect of continuous
learning and improvement was embraced and celebrated, along with frequent
feedback loops, enabling individuals to learn, adapt, and enhance their skills.
However, a continued focus on the traditional mechanistic processes of the
organization, rather than an understanding of the humanistic attributes of
agility, was eroding the benefits gained.
    We were able to make this conflict visible to teams and leaders alike by
using the focus of the Humanity stanchion. We demonstrated to the relevant
parties how the ways in which they were working did or didn’t align with what
the organization had come to expect. This process took time. And was still a
work in progress when we last engaged with them. However, what we saw at
that time, was leadership beginning to embrace the new way of working, and
understanding the humanistic focus, which was already creating results that
mechanistic processes could not achieve.
    Until now, we haven’t discussed our work with Remote:af as it pertains to
the stanchion of Humanity as the Cornerstone. Why? Because, when we
applied our ideas about governance to develop the remote governance
functionality for the Remote Agility Framework, we didn’t specifically name
Humanity as a pillar.
   This was because the framework already had a deep commitment to
including humanity as one of its fundamental purposes for existence. We didn’t
need to inject more humanity into the framework. We merely ensured that
elements of remote governance wrapped themselves around those concepts to
ensure that they considered human interactions.
   The founder of Remote:af, Andrew Blain, anticipated that COVID-19
would cause widespread societal shutdowns and businesses would need to
transition to remote working in order to survive. This gave the impetus to
design a remote-first way of working that could mimic human interactions,
but moving to digital first and indeed governing the entire system of work was
paramount to enabling this.
   Remote:af ’s remote governance, of course, made use of agile and had a
sharp focus on enabling the framework to handle human conditions generated
by the sudden (and, as we now know, new normal) shift to remote working.
Those conditions were the loss of visibility, control, connection, and learned
helplessness.
   In order to begin incorporating the Humanity stanchion into your own
organization, we recommend you:

      1. Familiarize yourself with the Heart of Agile: Learn about Dr.
      Alistair Cockburn’s model for simplifying and clarifying the critical
      imperatives of agility. Understand the emphasis on people and human
      interactions as the cornerstone of good governance.
      2. Reflect on the importance of humanity in governance: Consider
      how your current governance practices prioritize and incorporate the
      human element. Assess whether your organization’s culture promotes
      psychological safety, trust, transparency, and collaboration among
      teams.
      3. Adopt a human-centric approach to governance: If your
      governance practices seem to minimize or strip away humanity from
      teams, explore ways to shift towards a more human-centric system.
      Embrace principles like empowerment, trust, and a culture focused on
      safety.
      4. Analyze and improve your existing system: Before making
      disruptive changes, take the time to analyze your current governance
      system. Identify the constraints and the aspects that are working well
      and can be leveraged for broader benefits. Use this information to build
      better human engagement in the change process.
      5. Explore remote governance: If your organization has moved to
      remote or asynchronous work, consider exploring remote governance
      frameworks like Remote:af. Focus on incorporating human interactions
      and addressing the challenges associated with remote work, such as loss
      of visibility, control, connection, and learned helplessness.

  By taking these actions, you can begin to understand and implement the
importance of humanity as the cornerstone of good governance, leading to
more effective and human-centric approaches to decision-making and work
management.
