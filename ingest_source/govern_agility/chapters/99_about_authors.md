## About The Authors

Tony Ponton
My career has been eclectic, to say the least. I left a career in the music industry
and worked in many different jobs before landing in a large banking and
insurance organization in the early nineties. I fulfilled many roles for the
organization: trainer, software tester, and business analyst, before a stroke of
luck in the late 90s introduced me to agile. That organization became
Australia’s premier poster-child for agile transformation.
    I was extremely lucky to share that journey with a group of amazing agilists
whom I learned much from. Within that period, I spent my time coaching
large programs such as an Internet Banking Rebuild, and a Banking
Replacement Program. While doing so, I learned much about agile and
governance.
    Since that time, I have been active as a contributor and leader in the
Australian and global agile communities and am one of the co-creators, co-
authors, and vice-president of “The Remote Agility Framework”.
    In between helping organizations change the world of work, I co-chair one
of the world’s first and premier agile podcasts,
    The Agile Revolution, host the YouTube channel All the Remote Things, the
YouTube chat show @talkingremote, and serve as a Heart of Agile guide for the
global Heart of Agile movement.

I have truly had a diverse career and worked in various industries and types of
roles, with my first true job being in the Australian Army way back in 1991.
After university, in the early 2000s, I found myself working at a large bank in
Australia. It was embarking on their first experiments with the adoption of
agile methods in the technology space, and looking to expand that to project
delivery. I was fortunate enough to be in a position to take on the role of
project manager. The success of the project was amazing and somewhat
legendary, and it set up the next rounds of agile adoption within that
organization. I learned by doing, without actually understanding the theory. It
was only over the next fifteen years that I truly learned what agile is and needs.
It is said that success can be a bad teacher. I’ve found that applies to myself.
Every scenario is different—you really have to learn and rely on the people
around you to be successful.
   I moved to agile program delivery, software delivery, and eventually agile
transformations, enabling agile as a “thing” to move out of the technology
domain and into the wild. I’ve been fortunate to work in large organizations,
most recently with a global company trying to support the uplift of capability
across 80,000 people and seventeen countries. I have found my niche in how
we adopt agility across the organization, and over that time I have found that
the key constraints to success are not agile itself but rather the existing system
that works around it and rarely gets tackled as part of the change journey.
   I have worked extensively with Alistair Cockburn, one of the co-signatories
of the original agile manifesto, including in the creation of the Heart of Agile,
which is his approach to getting agile back to the essence of agility, including
being one of the first globally recognized guides, of which I am still active.
Tony and I are both Global Heart of Agile Guides. Most recently, with Andrew
Blain and team, I helped to co-create the initial Remote Agility Framework. I
was also recently recognized as an Executive Guide in Operating Model
Design.
   Tony and I have worked together over many years; we’ve contributed to and
given many talks, particularly on this topic of Agile Governance, and we are
both actively engaged and recognized as leaders in the agile industry in
Australia. This book is based on a series of talks we give at agile conferences, as
well as a series of blog posts we wrote to provide our view and early thinking
around how you inject agility into governance. It is humbling to be able to
write and produce this with Tony, who I count as one of the most authentic
and engaging Agilists you will ever meet.
