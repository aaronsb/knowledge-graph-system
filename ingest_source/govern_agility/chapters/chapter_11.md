## Chapter 11: The Virtual Obeya

When we were first developing our theories and practice of Agile Governance,
the fundamental query we kept coming back to was: How can we ensure that
information is kept clear and accessible, thus enabling the expeditious and
adaptable decision-making required in today’s VUCA world?
    From our experiences over the years, we’ve come to enjoy and appreciate the
advantages of creating a physical space dedicated to the transmission and
sharing of information. A space like this—known as an Obeya, the origins of
which we’ll explore shortly—is crucial to creating Agile Governance in any
organization. But today’s business context requires a digital solution to the
same question.
    The problem we kept running into while answering that first question was
that we were juggling two issues at the same time: how to keep information
clear and accessible, and how to facilitate the best parts of an Obeya in a digital
space. Serendipitously, just as we were debating these problems, we were
afforded the unique opportunity to become co-creators of the “Remote Agility
Framework (Remote:af )”1.
    In fact, it was the (virtually overnight) move to remote working for millions
of people that allowed us to dedicate serious time to the development of
Remote:af. This framework emerged from paying very close attention to
COVID-19 and the signals that showed, if one was paying attention, how the
evolution of the virus mimicked the patterns of the 1918 Spanish Flu. The
epidemiology and clinical features, as well as the resulting social and cultural
issues, reveal great similarities. Their outbreak pattern led the team we were
working with, and others, to hypothesize a similar duration and death burden
for COVID-19, in the absence of effective vaccines or innovative treatments.
This meant that some of the ways the world changed in the wake of COVID-
19 were predictable. It was Andrew Blain, co-founder of Remote:af, who was
one of the first to anticipate these changes, and take the initiative to move agile
and his frameworks into a purely digital context.
    This opportunity gave us the chance to incorporate the Five Stanchions as
well as our thoughts on the fledgling Virtual Obeya into the framework (we’ll
chat more on this in the following chapters). The next few chapters, in which
we explore the Virtual Obeya, are deeply rooted in the work we did while
creating the Remote Agility Framework, and we want to acknowledge
Remote:af for kindly allowing us to publish those ideas.
    Let’s begin with a brief overview of the Obeya—its past, present, and
future. Obeya, meaning “large room” in Japanese, is a single space where
leaders can come together to collaborate on solving complex problems.
    Although the term has roots in modern Japanese culture, the concept has
been practiced in many cultures for over two and a half millennia. The
Chinese, Greeks, and Egyptians, among others, all recognized the value in
creating an arena for debates, a forum for productive discussions, or a super-
charged environment where distractions are minimized and ideas fly so thick
and fast that solutions can be plucked out of the air. A war room, a command
center, or the bridge of the USS Enterprise.
    We now use Obeya in a management context. The Obeya room might
contain team leads, department heads, engineers, managers, etc. Stepping into
an Obeya room, you know it’s time to focus. You’ll be working with leaders
from technology, legal, sales, human resources, and more. The agenda is clear:
a single problem to solve that needs input and expertise from every area of the
business. It could be a product that needs designing, an initiative that needs to
be launched, or a strategy that’s gotten lost in the weeds. It could be the
creation of a mission team designed purposefully to achieve a valuable
outcome.
    Crucial information is clearly displayed. The end goal is established. The
mood is high. Everyone is united and aligned; nobody is there to score points.
Everyone is elbow-to-elbow, sharing their perspectives. Hierarchy is flattened.
The team acts as one. In the Stanchion of Data-Driven Reasoning, we declare
that the more open, accessible, real-time, and accurate our data, the better the
decisions. And, just as we keep one eye on our instrumentation when driving a
car—using our speedometer and fuel gauge to track progress, and our
temperature gauge and engine lights to keep aware of potential faults—so
should we keep one eye on our team and department data when working on
projects. That makes the Obeya an organization’s Heads-Up Display.
    This isn’t a radical concept for most modern organizations. In fact, even if
they never use the term Obeya, they have the capacity to create something that
functions similarly. You’ll often see this in emergency situations: a crisis center
is spun up almost instantly. People are directed to work collaboratively, often
across functions and boundaries, to quickly work through the scenario and
solve the issue. We got to see this in action a few years back while working
with a large Australian Telecommunications organization to define the drivers
and impediments to designing an enterprise agile transformation. The
common call out was that the organization was able to respond quickly and
work well in a crisis, so how might they capture that intent and collaboration
more often? And sustain it? One key element contributing to the success of
this approach was their use of a “war room”, functionally an Obeya. The
problem was that, although this was a place full of information and access to
communication, and even though it was open to people spread across not just
Australia but the entire globe, it wasn’t optimized for digitality.
    An Obeya that’s optimized for its users and context can be a magical place.
High communication, high collaboration, and everyone working in alignment
towards a common goal. If you haven’t enjoyed the unique atmosphere of an
Obeya room before, this might all sound a little fanciful. That many leaders in
one space with no arguments or miscommunications? All the relevant
information on display without people becoming overloaded? Isn’t that just
another massive meeting? We’ll admit, making an Obeya function well isn’t
simply a matter of throwing a handful of leaders into a room. There are
definitely best practices and principles at play that make the Obeya work, and
we’ll be exploring them shortly. But all we want to do for the moment is give
you that visual: a big space, filled with experts and information, all aligned and
rowing in the same direction.
    However, with remote/hybrid ways of working become the norm, and most
Australian and global organizations landing on at least a 3:2 office/home split
in the knowledge worker domains, getting all the necessary people into a single
Obeya type space is becoming more and more difficult. At the same time, it’s
increasingly necessary for organizations (and people at all levels of those
organizations) to have a place where they can absorb the information—data,
opinions, trade secrets, unique perspectives, and so on—that they need to do
their jobs. And let’s not forget, that information is endless! How often do you
see or hear the quote: “I’m drowning in a sea of data yet starving for
knowledge”? History tends to repeat in different spheres of human endeavor.
As Coleridge wrote: “Water, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink!”2
   The ability to synthesize, cut through the noise, and create meaningful
insights that are actionable, can’t happen without the collaboration of people.
Which means, as we covered in Chapter 9, Data-Driven Reasoning, availability
and transparency. It also means, as we covered in Chapter 10, Humanity as the
Cornerstone, that people are the necessary ingredient to drive that
collaboration.
   So, we need to make the Obeya virtual.
   At this point, we guarantee there’s at least one reader asking: “Isn’t that just
a more organized Zoom meeting?”
   If only it were that simple.
   Let’s dive deeper into what makes an Obeya unique. It’s not just a place to
mingle. It’s not only a space where information can be shared. It’s more than a
communal hub for focused discussion. And it has to be more than the centers
of communication that are thrown up quickly in times of crisis. That model
must be made ubiquitous, stable, and fundamental to the organization’s
culture. Its information must transcend time and place in this distributed
world. Finally, it must serve as an effective replacement to the current
governance approach of 100-page status reports that are out of date by the
time they’re submitted.
   An Obeya is a place that radiates information: from people to people, from
the organization to the organization, and from country to country. It supports
multiple perspectives simultaneously while facilitating cross-communication. It
adapts to the needs of users instead of asking them to adapt to the limitations
of the room. It enables autonomy through directional alignment, rather than
dictating alignment by removing autonomy. It’s more than just a modified
SharePoint site or a confluence wiki page. In fact, it’s not an exaggeration to
say that it’s the missing ingredient that brings agile to life.
   When you compare this vision of an Obeya against the core values of agile,
you may feel there’s a conflict with the statement, “Working Software (Things)
over Comprehensive Documentation”. We disagree; a Virtual Obeya doesn’t
conflict with this notion. The Obeya values people and interactions over
documentation, but recognizes the need to record the conversations, the
agreements, and the decisions made by people and processes, while individuals
are interacting with each other. How often have you asked somebody for
further information about a recent decision and gotten the reply, “We’re agile.
We don’t do documentation!” It’s frustrating and causes a high degree of
friction and tension in the overall system. In fact, it creates uncertainty, reduces
trust, leads to increased governance and slows down decision-making—the
exact opposite outcome of what adopting agile is meant to achieve. We prefer
to look at the preposition over. People, working software, and good outcomes
are more important than documentation. But documentation is still
important, and an Obeya can help to capture that.
    All of these factors combine to form a space that creates connective tissue
throughout an organization. The processing center at the heart of the nervous
system, if you will. Just as our nerve endings let us gather information, it’s the
brain that brings all the synapses and nerve endings together. A single place
that uses all of the organization’s senses to provide information. Which in turn
guides those directionally aligned decisions necessary for a 21st century
organization’s success.
    You can see why, as we noted earlier, the Virtual Obeya is an essential part
of Agile Governance.
    You can also see why building a Virtual Obeya is more complex than an
online chat with bonus breakout rooms. Many of the most ubiquitous online
communication platforms (Zoom, Teams, Google Meets, and whatever else has
launched by the time this book lands in your hands) aim to recreate a
traditional, top-down meeting structure. One person (or a small team)
controls, presents, and dictates the pace. Information is not radiated but
funneled from the few to the many. Conversations are a series of one-on-one
engagements and cross-communication is discouraged or disabled entirely,
which makes directional alignment difficult. If you’re not part of the
channel/chat, or aren’t familiar with the structure, information remains hard to
come by. Want to get that crucial information for yourself? Then you’re relying
upon individuals to share it with you, and finding those individuals isn’t always
easy.
    What we find with platforms like Teams and Zoom is that they essentially
replicate the physical world—complete with the same hierarchy and
limitations—without daring to imagine what a truly digital-centric approach
could accomplish.
    The Virtual Obeya is separate from the status quo. It allows us to imagine
something different.
   Something new.
   Something necessary.
   To figure out how we can create an effective Virtual Obeya, let’s start by
digging into the makeup of a good Obeya. We can begin with four areas called
“Mados” that, combined, create the Obeya as a whole. We use the term Mados
(Japanese for window) as they are transparent panes through which we can
peer into the organization’s information flow.
   These Mados are:

![Figure](images/page-008.png)


          Strategy;
          Work;
          Data; and
          Culture.

   We’ll discuss them in summary:
    The Strategy Mado: a window into how strategy is decomposed across the
organization. This helps us understand not just the directional alignment of
remote teams, but how those teams are being aligned. To facilitate
organizational strategy, we need to create or enable a system that enables
information to flow back to strategy planning teams, creates visibility onto the
strategic intent so clear and total that everyone from the cleaner to the
executive understands the why behind strategy and how it links to delivery,
and enables expedient, informed, and strategically aligned directional
decisions/interventions.
    The Work Mado: how we create visibility in a virtual environment. It
allows us to visualize the work portfolio across individual and multiple teams,
programs, or areas of the organization. It gathers concrete data from teams,
teams of teams, and the enterprise, and weaves it into a single, interconnected
system of information that can be used to guide strategic decisions, encourage
transparency and alignment, and provide real-time lead and lag indicators of
business performance.
   The Data Mado: all about aggregating data on the progress, performance,
and flow efficiency of the organization. This is why we call it the underpinning
Mado—without it, the other Mados would teeter and collapse. It’s a window
into how the sausage gets made—the metrics behind decisions both major and
minor. Getting this data organized and visible is integral to peeling away the
layers of organizational information and reporting detritus and sourcing the
critical data needed to enable fact-based and data-driven reasoning.
   The Culture Mado: is a window into the health of an organization (both
the personal, team, and team-of-teams), their social connections, external
interactions, and working hours and agreements from the enterprise level all
the way down to the individual. When this information is visible and
accessible, leaders can proactively use it to understand the behaviors that are
expected, accepted, and agreed upon within the organization. They can
examine and understand team interactions both internally and externally.
Leaders can also learn how teams grow, learn, and maintain excellence.
  Let’s briefly discuss some commonalities between the Mados (and in turn,
Obeyas).
  To create any of the four Mados, a higher order of information is required.
We covered the intent of these in Chapter 9, Data-Driven Reasoning. Breaking
down further these include:

           Strategy and its decomposition into objectives for vertical
      connectivity—the “Why”
          Kanban systems for horizontal alignment across teams executing
      work—the “How”
          Measures and metrics that have been evolved for the new state of
      remote working and underpinned by data analysis—the “What”
         Risks, issues, progress, sequencing, and dependencies for governance
      and delivery
         Team and people information for engagement, cultural norms, and
      health
         Continuous Improvement, planning, and execution

   The degree of granularity required for any of these information streams (or
the focus given to each stream per Mado) will vary depending on the needs of
the teams. For example, enterprise strategy metrics versus team performance.
   There are no two identical organizations and, in turn, no two identical
Virtual Obeyas. What each organization does with their Obeya—the ways in
which they organize, prioritize, and emphasize their data, culture, processes,
and strategies—will depend on which aspects of the business they value, which
they feel confident in, which they feel need greater structure and support, and
so on.
   These four Mados, the information they make visible, and the ways in
which that information can be used, are not strict rules. What we have
provided here are only suggestions, guiding lights that can help you find your
way towards better Agile Governance to achieve the results you’re after. Your
Obeya should reflect your organization, your teams, and your purpose. So,
take the time to design your Obeya purposefully and within the context of
your ways of working.
