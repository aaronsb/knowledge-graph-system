## Chapter 1: What is Agile Governance?

In the early days of 2019, we were invited to work with a global organization
that was struggling to meet their customers’ needs. This was despite close to a
century of history, culture, and deeply held traditions that drove their ways of
working.
    But maybe that was the problem. This organization maintained a classic,
project-driven philosophy. They had long lead times and high levels of Work in
Progress. The result was high overhead, high levels of waste, and little
throughput—a typical 12-month funding cycle often took 18 months to bear
fruit.
    And as we dug deeper, more problems surfaced. Their teams were
fragmented and siloed, working with disparate methodologies while poor
communication and low transparency made it tough to get the data they
needed to make decisions. Leadership was reminiscent of traditional
approaches, focused on managing tasks rather than enabling teams. There were
nods to more agile ways of working, but under the modern labels you found
old-school administration. While there were pockets of strength and intent,
the system was in conflict with itself.
    Drawing threads between these symptoms pointed to one glaring problem:
the lack of Agile Governance.
    For those stepping into the world of agile for the first time, let’s make sure
we’re all speaking the same language. We use the following definitions when
discussing agile. Agile Governance is neither a framework nor a process. It is an
intention, a series of questions to be asked, insights to be gained, and a frame
of reference.
   Agile (adjective): having the ability to move and change direction quickly,
easily, and gracefully.
   Dynamically Adaptive Organizations1: organizations that are dynamically
evolving, changing, and adapting to meet the difficulties of the internal and
external VUCA environments that enterprises must navigate every day in order
to weather and thrive through the storms of disruption.
   Governance2: the way that organizations or countries are managed at the
highest level, and the systems for doing this: “Corporate Governance – we aim
to promote and maintain the highest standards of directorship and corporate
governance.”
   Agile Governance: applying the values and principles of agility to the way
we govern an organization. In other words, ensuring the mechanisms,
constraints, strategies, and delivery methods of the entire company are nimble
and adaptive.
   You’re likely already familiar with the first term. Maybe even the second, if
you’ve worked in the technology sector at any time over the past few decades.
You may already know that agile originated in software development, and has
subsequently evolved as a way of addressing the ever-changing demands of an
increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. You
might even have encountered agile outside of software delivery. You don’t have
to be part of a technology development team to see the value in developing
more flexible, responsive mindsets and methods.
   Agile Governance, on the other hand, is still a relatively fresh concept even
for agilists. It asks that we broaden our scope, widen our understanding
beyond projects, teams, departments, or even release trains, and apply the
fundamental concepts of agility to how we govern the system as a whole.
   For many, it’s a complicated mindset shift.
   This book aims to make that shift a whole lot easier.
   The big question is: why does Agile Governance matter? What does it
provide that other methods of governance don’t?
   We just mentioned that the world is becoming increasingly VUCA –
volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. We don’t need to explain how
economic, social, and political volatility have become the rule in the first half
of the 21st century. As volatility increases, predictability drops, so it’s no
wonder that uncertainty is on the rise. Global interconnectivity is one of many
factors increasing complexity, with more systems, more people and opinions,
and more fingers tipping more scales. As for ambiguity, it seems that the more
information we have at our fingertips, the harder it is to determine truth from
fiction.
    We’ll dive further into VUCA later in this book. What matters for now is
that Agile Governance enables integrity, transparency, and trust throughout
your system of work which helps in addressing the challenges in navigating the
modern VUCA world.
    Agile Governance is achieved by moving the focus of working methods
away from processes and tools, and towards individuals and interactions—this
is, in fact, the first value of The Agile Manifesto3. Agile Governance accelerates
information flow across the entire organization, rather than targeting specific
teams or departments. This means that the time taken for an idea to become a
decision, to become an action, and then to become an outcome, is minimized
—crucial, when the world is changing faster than we can react to it. Or as an
old colleague of ours used to say, “Problems change faster than we can develop
and deploy the solutions to solve them”.
    Acceleration isn’t a fresh concept to the seasoned agilist—agile ways of
working have always had the capacity to build pace—yet not implementing
modern governance along with modernizing your working systems eventually
forces them to bow to traditional forms of governance, disempowering them
and draining their autonomy. While acceleration and “moving at pace” are the
current management buzzwords to drive things forward, in this case the old
adage rings true: “The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back.”4
    In other words, if building agility within teams is like being handed the
keys to a Ferrari, not using agile in your governance system is like driving
without getting out of first gear.5
    Agile Governance is far from the only form of governance that can enable
your organization to function faster, more flexibly, and more transparently. For
example, Lean Governance, which has its roots in the Lean Movement and
TPS (Toyota Production System), has a strong genealogy, and is a governance
method focused on streamlined structures and processes, which enables
working together effectively to produce meaningful value for customers. It
achieves this via oversight and decision-making regarding spending, auditing,
and compliance measures, and by forecasting expenses and measurement. And
all of these factors are important. However, they aren’t the totality of good
Agile Governance. They seek to add governance to your agility. We want to
add agility to your governance.
   So how do we implement Agile Governance? That’s a big question, and one
we’ll explore comprehensively throughout this book. In short, you can expect
to need:

![Figure](images/page-001.png)


          Strong, enthusiastic leadership that communicates effectively;
          Commitment to distributed risk management;
          Buy-in across all levels of the organization;
          People across the organization who take responsibility for work and
       outcomes;
          Practice and implementation that keeps pace with intent.

   Achieve this and you have the foundations of good Agile Governance. If
not, you’ll be struggling to benefit from the spontaneity and vision of humans,
even from talented teams. It’s often reflected that variability is what excites the
intrapreneurs, giving you a competitive advantage. Without it, your people will
find their dreams of empowerment, and the promise of human centricity that
agile brings, slowly crumbling. Learned helplessness will prevail, and the
organization will suffer. It will become reflective of the great five year planned
economies of the soviet era, where the nation, and its subordinate (often
invaded) satellite states, consisted of a rolling series of centralized economic
plans, which were based on the Communist Party’s theories of economic and
social development.
   We know where that leads!
   If you’re midway through this chapter and feeling as if Agile Governance is
a radical departure from the governance frameworks you’re used to, take
comfort. Many organizations are already targeting Agile Governance, which
often begins with agile-type transformations away from functional based silos
and towards cross-functional teams. Call them tribes, domains, customer
journeys, value streams, or release trains—they take many different forms.
However, the fundamental purpose is the same: descaling and de-
bureaucratizing the organization in pursuit of increasing speed of execution by
removing barriers to change. This isn’t the entirety of creating Agile
Governance, but it is a great first step.
   Is it possible to change structure in pursuit of agility and create more
problems than you originally had? Of course. Is pursuing agility without
properly re-thinking Agile Governance increasing risk to your transformation
goals? Also, yes. Agile Governance looks complex. If it were simple, everyone
would already be doing it. If you zoom out and look at the purpose and
methodologies of Agile Governance from a distance, you’ll see that it stands
upon five simple stanchions (the definition of a stanchion6 for this book is “a
vertical pole used to support something”):

      1. Conductive Leadership7—in essence, leaders conducting their teams
      like an orchestra, demonstrating clear intent, guiding their teams
      through decision-making, and standing ready to begin targeted
      interventions when problems arise. Creating harmony so their teams
      and their organization play in concert.
      2. Sensible Transparency—to break down the walls of organizational
      silos, enabling transparency, open inquiry, greater alignment, and bi-
      directional information flow.
      3. Patterns of Work—to redesign and codify ways of working across
      whole organizations in a way that enhances flow, distributes control,
      and ensures complete clarity of purpose and intent.
      4. Data-Driven Reasoning—to collect, analyze and apply data using
      automated digital tools in a way that creates clarity, allows data to trump
      opinion, enables constant and continual improvement, and gets leaders
      out of their offices and down to the spaces where the work is being
      done.
      5. Humanity—at the center of these four stanchions is a fifth stanchion
      that forms a cornerstone of Agile Governance: Humanity. Not cashflow,
      or productivity, or output. Humanity. To strip away artificial constraints
      and let people think and act independently, to communicate honestly,
      to fulfill the needs of their colleagues and customers, and to take pride
      in their accomplishments. To trust one another, to take responsibility, to
      align through democratic decision-making, to treat one another fairly,
      and to approach others with humility. We often see these statements as
      core values and principles plastered on the office wall, or the corporate
      intranet site, while the actual behaviors, controls, processes and actions
      inside organizations directly contradict them. Humanity as the
       cornerstone means living and embodying these values, not simply
       paying them lip service.

    During the time we spent crystallizing ideas and writing this book, we had
an ongoing and vigorous debate about the use of the term Stanchions: “a
vertical pole used to support something”. The metaphor relates to something
being rigid and tending to have an enduring structure. Given we are talking
about injecting agility into governance, and the core aspects of agility are
movement and responsiveness, is it right to fix something? We think it is
useful, as the Stanchions themselves are enduring containers where multiple
practices and methods can reside and move, changing when the environment
or the need changes. It’s the anchor to change around. Maybe one day they
will change as well.
    Agile Governance is about changing the controls to reflect new ways of
working and thinking. It places insights and opportunities into the hands of
the entire organization, allowing for team, department, or whole-of-
organization agility. It builds trust between leadership and teams, while using a
data-driven feedback model to ensure that trust is well-placed. It lets people be
people. And it paves the way to the promise of Enterprise agility.
    There’s nothing more important than that.
    Let’s return to our Global Organization from earlier in the chapter and
imagine how an Agile Governance structure might have alleviated the
challenges they were facing. Could smaller teams, arranged into tight and
aligned teams of teams, have solved their siloing and collaboration issues? If
management had been more versed in agile thinking, could they have put
more effort into enabling their teams rather than micromanaging tasks? Would
communication have become more transparent, helping them conquer their
extended lead-times? Would greater visibility of work have improved trust
between teams and leadership?
    All of these concepts are interwoven. Building agility might begin with a
single step, however you can’t pluck at the thread of visibility to tighten up
trust and call it a day. Creating visibility creates courage, but not all data points
are equal or good. If you want to build true Agile Governance, you need to
apply these new ways of thinking to the organization as a whole and allow all
information to flow, good or bad.
    That’s crucial, because what some organizations mistakenly see as agile—
changing team dynamics or implementing a new workplace tool—is a
reductionist, simplistic approach to a complex adaptive system; a knee-jerk
response to the new normal. They adapt piecemeal to the challenges of today
without considering the potential of tomorrow. It’s the window dressing of the
problems you want, nay need, to solve.
    New normal? It’s an almost useless concept. Part of accepting the reality of a
VUCA world is acknowledging that, by the time you’ve latched on to a new
normal, it’s already fading into irrelevance. What’s more important is to build
governance that’s always ready for the next normal.
    This requires considered and intentional organizational design, focused on
creating or enhancing collaborative connective tissues. These tissues need to be
able to respond to new strategies and opportunities quickly by pivoting
structures and operating models in near-real time. This in turn enables
communication, information flow, and maximizes the speed of directional
decisions. Agile Governance, the governing of the system as a whole, is what
enables this.
    If you have watched the series, The Witcher8 (namely Season 3, Episode 3),
you might remember this quote at the conclave from Geralt of Rivia when
questioned on how he lives in a changing world and stays true: “I shall continue
on my path. I shall respond to events. I’ll adapt with the world as it changes.”
    We can’t tell you what the next two, five, or ten years will bring. The future
of global economics, politics, and business is as opaque to us as it is to you. We
first learned how to make continuous delivery work with green screens,
mainframes, and huge stored procedures when agile was still novel and being
practiced by technologists only—anyone remember using AS4009? Look where
we are now, how fast our sociotechnical world is changing. Agile is table stakes,
and your mobile phone has more compute power than the first manned
mission to space. In fact, the Apollo Missions’ Guidance Computer’s
performance was comparable to the first generation of home computers from
the late 1970s.
    Moore’s Law10 seems to still have some relevance.
    However, we can promise you that, by reading this book and applying the
lessons within, you will be in a better position to adapt and thrive throughout
the next normal (and the next, and the next).
    Want to build true Agile Governance in your organization? We’re ready to
show you how.
