## Preface

When we wrote this book, we wanted to ensure that we portrayed the
landscape of governance from what we have seen organizations experience and,
more importantly, the foibles and frustrations of holding onto the methods of
the past while attempting to move forward.
With that in mind, we have focussed the first few chapters on our observations
of the world at large. We then provide insights into what we have learned, and
techniques we have used, that help address this dynamic.
You will hear us refer to “we” a lot. Essentially, this is from either an experience
we have had together, or one of us has had, and for ease we have made it a
collective pronoun.
Thank you for choosing to read this book. It’s our explicit hope that we
provide you with the compass to guide you to a better way to enable your
organization to deal with the new now and adapt to the next problems the
future might throw at you.
