## Chapter 5: Agile Governance

                       and the Five Stanchions
Let’s recap, just in case you skipped the first few chapters to get to the juicy
parts.
    Governance is a broad term for the entire system through which an
organization operates, as well as the processes, mechanisms, and systems
traditionally used as ubiquitous mechanisms to keep people accountable for
their work and outcomes. This encompasses fields like ethics, risk
management, funding, and compliance amongst others.
    Traditional governance operates through measures and controls. Even in
purportedly agile organizations, teams are kept accountable through metrics,
audits, and top-down bureaucracy. The result is a system at war with itself that
can never achieve true agility.
    Agile Governance takes the rules that evolved in a traditional governance
ecosystem, uses them as a chrysalis for change, and emerges from them in
order to enable integrity, transparency, and trust throughout a system of work.
When organizations adopt new operating models with the goal of enabling
agility, they need to ensure their governance is agile as well.
    Agile Governance can’t be definitively classified as either a framework or a
process. It is an intention, a series of questions to be asked and insights to be
gained, a frame of reference. It is a reflection upon the ways in which you work
and the ways in which you wish you were working. It gives you new lenses,
fresh eyes, but you must build the structure yourself in a way that fits your
organization. There is nothing unique or novel about the idea of injecting
agility into the way we govern—we have seen the successful adoption of these
questions, intentions and philosophies in many industries and environments
over the centuries. That said, we have refined the methods by which you can
work through those questions, and craft the next directional actions that will
take you closer to an Agile Governance system. We know it works because
we’ve been living it for years. Now we’re sharing it with you.
   Before we explore the primary components of Agile Governance, it’ll be
useful to jump back in time and show you how and why we developed our
thinking and structure. It was late 2019, and we’d already been working with a
number of organizations over many years, helping them better understand
their own governance and how it could be honed in service of better agile
outcomes. We gave organizations fresh perspectives and helped them take a
system-wide look at how they could strengthen their strategy and continue to
deliver to their customers in an ever-changing world. Throughout these
engagements, patterns were emerging as to what enabled good governance
(and conversely, what was lacking in organizations struggling with their
governance) on the change journey to be an agile organization. Around the
same time, one of our contacts invited us to review a governance construct that
had been set up in their business.
   We decided that we needed a mechanism in place to facilitate that review
and sat down to crystallize our findings and theories into what we hoped
would be a simple model (and it was, in the end, though distilling complexity
into approachability is no easy task). We’ve learned that one of the most
challenging things in the world is to take a complex idea and make it simple to
understand without oversimplifying it. There is a quote often attributed to
Albert Einstein that fits this learning: “that all physical theories, their
mathematical expressions apart ought, to lend themselves to so simple a
description that even a child could understand them.”1
   We already had a wealth of information at hand on how concepts such as
transparency, leadership, ways of working, and information flow impacted
good governance. However, the questions were where things got interesting.
   We started asking: How do these concepts intersect and influence one
another? What links needed to be drawn, and which should be discarded? How
could organizations self-reflect, gather the necessary data, and create insights in
the service of positive change? How could we, taking a system view, use these
ideas in a way that converged and transformed all our collected information
into a useful, applicable tool?
   Instead of starting from zero, we used the Heart of Agile as the foundation
and fundamental premise which allowed us to crystallize our ideas.
What is the Heart of Agile?
To understand the stanchions of Agile Governance, and how we have evolved
them, a quick synopsis of the Heart of Agile is in order. Formulated by Agile
Manifesto co-author Dr. Alistair Cockburn, the Heart of Agile is a fresh
approach to agile that eliminates two decades of (arguably) unnecessary
complications and ornamentations and gets to the core outcome. In fact,
Alistair would argue it’s not fresh; it’s a re-simplification. It asks: What do you
really want to achieve by adopting agility? The answer is to change the world
for the better, if only a little. How can you accomplish this? With four key
imperatives that stand independent of any agile toolset or process and allow
you to strip away the theater and noise and get back to the basics. They are:

                                                                2


           Collaborate (closely with others to generate and develop better starting
       ideas. Communicate often to smooth transitions);
           Deliver (small probes initially to learn how the world really works.
       Expand deliveries as you learn to predict and influence outcomes);
           Reflect (periodically, along the way. Think about what you’ve learned in
       your collaboration and from your deliveries); and
           Improve (the direction of your ideas, their technical implementation,
       and your internal processes).

   The key to agility, and how we use it across governance, is to master the
basics. Both of us are long term proponents of Martial Arts, a never-ending
journey striving for perfection. Its foundation, the root of karate, is Mastering
the Basics—the Heart of Agile nudges us back to that core concept. In fact,
one of Alistair’s other core philosophies, which he teaches in his advanced agile
masterclasses, is also drawn from martial arts and supports this underpinning:
the just master the basics mantra. Shu, Ha, Ri, Kokoro3.




                                                                     4


          Shu: This is the learning stage, where you basically just follow the
      rules. Think of the time when perhaps you’ve been to boxing classes or
      karate dojos for the first time and the Sensei or instructors are training
      their students: they expect you to just follow and learn. You follow the
      teaching without understanding the concept. You follow the rules.
          Ha: This is the stage where a student starts to branch out. Theories
      and concepts are starting to come into practice. Perhaps you’re moving
      to learn from other teachers. You are actually breaking the rules.
         Ri: This is where learning from others directly ends. You are the
      master; you are creating your own practices and passing them on to
      others. You are creating the rules.
          Kokoro: This is the spirit, the center, and the heart of things. You
      return to radical simplicity, and it fundamentally becomes just
      mastering the basics. You are returning to the core of learning, coming
      full circle.
    If you’re a long-term agilist, then you’ll already recognize how these four
words align with agile thinking and how you start with learning the basic
practices. If you’re not, we bet you can still see how these basic imperatives can
drive any project, process, or community along the road to improvement.
    When we began building the stanchions of Agile Governance, we wanted
them to exist independently of commonly used agile ways of working. Will
Kanban and Scrum still exist in their current forms in five, ten, or twenty
years? It’s impossible to predict. Concepts, however, like collaboration and
reflection, are eternal.
Next Steps
With the Heart of Agile as our foundation, we then placed ourselves in the
shoes of this organization and asked, what do you need? Our ideas evolved as
we examined the why behind each need. We also knew we needed to make this
model compelling. It needed to be not just a series of steps or a bundle of
tools, but a story that could create investment, self-reflection, and demonstrate
a relatable progression pathway. It needed to be actionable, directional, and
valuable—and as a result, acceptable to the executive leadership group who
commissioned the work and to whom we were providing guidance. Often you
see consultant-created models that offer to solve the business problem but
don’t resonate with an executive team, and as a result don’t gain traction. Vice
versa, you also often see stories that the executive group readily align to yet fail
the execution test.
   We knocked our heads together until we had a working model based
around what we thought were the most pivotal stanchions of Agile
Governance. By presenting our review to the leadership team through the lens
of those stanchions, we were able to create a level of understanding and
investment we’d not quite achieved previously. They were used to construct
projects focused on project management office (PMO), project governance,
funding, ongoing work, etc. To their credit, they were well-versed in how
agility could influence the outcomes of projects and customer satisfaction, with
at least one of their large-scale digital transformations adopting elements of
agile in its operating model.
   By contrast, the stanchions allowed the leadership team to understand, for
the first time, how (for example) specifically improving their transparency
would have flow-on effects across the entire system. They were able to ask:
What are we doing to generate transparency, and how do we share that
information? What mechanisms are in place to maintain transparency? How
do we plan for and collaborate on transparency? What are cadences and
sequences of that planning? How do we visualize the flow of work, and radiate
that information throughout the organization?
    This leadership team was able to make big, positive changes as a result of
our working model. We were excited, but we needed more data.
    Over time, we have observed large amounts of governance. Expensive
governance. Big governance that involved lots of people across many
portfolios, programs, and projects. From billions in annual investment to
millions annually and many in between. However, was it good governance? Was
it governance aimed at solving the right problems? Did it even know the right
problems? These were trickier questions. We continued consulting and helped
a lot of businesses institute a lot of changes. We directly lobbied leadership to
increase informational transparency, to be more directional in their decisions,
to limit the work they were taking into the system, and so on. As we will go
into detail with this particular stanchion, transparency can often be a double-
edged sword that comes at a cost.
    Many of the ideas we were proposing were not particularly radical. What
was new and exciting for our clients and colleagues, was the holistic
combination of these ideas into a frame of reference that affected the
governance of the system as a whole. There were already many schools of
thought on how to spread agility horizontally throughout an organization, and
a few explored how to move agility through the layers. However, the idea of a
single, unified method that did both sparked incredible amounts of interest
that we did not expect.
    All the while, we evolved our ideas. Our collection of stanchions became
more focused over time, but it soon became clear that something was missing.
    Our mistake was a common one. We intertwined processes and the people
behind them to such an extent that the people became lost. We decided to add
one final, crucial stanchion, which focused on giving the people at the heart of
any system the spotlight they deserved.
    It worked. The missing piece did more than fill in a gap—it elevated the
entire model. We took opportunities to incorporate these ideas into other
engagements. When the pandemic first hit in early 2020 and there was an
exaptive moment where it seemed the entire world would move to working
from home, we modified the model for the remote context. We then codified
this with the Remote Agility Framework (we will explain this framework and
our work on it further on in the book), as well as fresh consultancy
opportunities. We tested our model in the field. We reflected. We refined it.
And we continue to reflect and refine, even in the process of writing this book.
   So, we come to the stanchions themselves.
The Five Stanchions of Agile Governance
The delicately curved roof of the Greek Parthenon relies on the support of
sixty-nine mighty stone columns. Agile Governance manages fine with just
five. These stanchions are the foundations upon which good, responsive,
human-centric governance can be built. In fact, we believe these five
stanchions are required for effectively governing any modern system of work,
agile or not. You’ll find most organizations are somewhat hybrid, with some
agile teams, some fixed, planned waterfall teams, and some departments that
blend the two. The stanchions are the connectors that combine these many
methods and provide clarity, communication, and synergy. They are:

      1. Conductive Leadership;
      2. Sensible Transparency;
      3. Patterns of Work;
      4. Data-Driven Reasoning; and
      5. Humanity as the Cornerstone.

   Let’s break each of those down into a bite-sized concept.
   Conductive Leadership is about moving away from a mechanistic approach
where people are cogs in a machine, to a humanistic approach where creativity
and individualism can flourish. To be conductive means to operate like a
conductor in an orchestra: guiding, strengthening, providing a tempo and
synchronization, without directly controlling the hands of your performers. In
short, if you can’t change the way you lead, you can’t change the way you
govern.
   Sensible Transparency is one of the keys to agility, namely the speed at
which information flows around the organization. Without information, you
can’t make decisions. Without transparency of information, you can’t build
trust. Creating Sensible Transparency requires purposeful design which enables
true collaborative connective tissues, which in turn gives you the speed and
flow required for success.
    Patterns of Work is the question of how we work, how we organize, and
how we complete work. This encompasses processes and tools, as well as the
mindsets we employ, and the systems that support and enable those mindsets.
Whether it’s continuous delivery, project-based thinking, charts, plans,
compliance methodologies, and so on, we need to ensure our patterns of work
are designed with the intention of optimizing productivity, maximizing
learning, and evolving for continuous improvement. Who knows best when it
comes to execution? The people doing the work: the teams and the people on
the ground. Who knows best when it comes to what we need? Leaders, and
what we need the teams to align to. How do we meet in the middle?
    Data-Driven Reasoning is about what we measure, how we measure it, and
how we use that information to make decisions. You’re probably familiar with
the classic metrics: time, cost, scope, and quality. What about customer
satisfaction or team happiness? Are these truly the measures we need to succeed
in a VUCA world? What about lead time, cycle time, and flow efficiency? And
once we’ve decided on what data we need, how can we gather and understand
it fast enough to keep up with the pace of change?
    Finally, let’s think of Humanity as the Cornerstone to good Agile
Governance. This means putting people in the work instead of bringing work
to the people. It means making workers the true custodians of good
governance. A scaling down of mechanistic controls, and a maturation of trust
and ownership.
    These five stanchions don’t just illuminate what can be added to an
organization in order to improve governance. They also illuminate how you
can improve governance through removing key factors such as misalignments,
roadblocks, and entrenched cultural aspects that inhibit good governance.
They are not a series of rules to follow, or an inviolable bible of how to do
effective governance. We want these ideas to be taken and experimented with,
shaped, evolved. We want you to use them in the ways that work for you and
discard whatever doesn’t. Two, five, or ten years from now, the stanchions may
have taken on all-new forms and contexts thanks to you, shaped to suit the
emergent business ecosystems of the 21st century.
    What could be more agile, after all?
    In the next chapters, we’ll work through each of the five stanchions one by
one and get you thinking about where your organization stands in relation to
these foundational concepts.
