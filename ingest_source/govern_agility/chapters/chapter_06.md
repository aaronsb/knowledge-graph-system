## Chapter 6: Stanchion #1: Conductive Leadership

Agility, by its very nature, disseminates control. The degree to which autonomy
increases can vary industry by industry or team by team, however, you can
generally assume that the greater the agility, the greater the level of self-
determination.
   Leadership doesn’t always function like this. In traditional governance
models, a common practice of leadership is to design and manage tightly to
control in one form or another. So, it’s no wonder the emergent struggle with
the introduction of agility, creates a perception of taking away or lessening that
control.
   This can result in less-than-desirable behaviors from people who want to
retain traditional models of leadership—for example, micromanagement, new
controls, constant demands for metrics proving the value of agility… We
mentioned previously, in fact several times, that the harder you push for
change, the harder the system pushes back. Nowhere is this more apparent
than in the conduct of leaders who feel agility introduces risk.
   What’s the solution? Get rid of leaders? Toss out middle-management?
   Absolutely not. Great leaders are game changers and essential to successful
agile enterprises. While hierarchy can be a dirty word in certain contexts, we
also recognize that effective hierarchies are crucial to the success of many
modern, agile organizations. Having clear responsibilities and accountabilities,
delineations of power over/under/for/to, and iron-clad agreements on who sets
the direction for the team to row in, can all work in the favor of the customer.
Meanwhile, flattened hierarchical structures such as Holacracy have enabled
many organizations to find success; however, they have left other organizations
tangled in webs of opaque accountabilities. Holacracy is one of those things
that, although it really buys into the human element with radical autonomy,
has a lot in common with communism. Looks great on paper but is often a
disaster in practice.
   The takeaway is that hierarchy itself is neither blessing nor curse. Context is
king. An absolute verdict on leadership models isn’t helpful, because no two
organizations or customers are alike.
   What we need is a new approach to leadership.
   We call it Conductive Leadership.
Where did Conductive Leadership come from?
To understand how we came to conceptualize Conductive Leadership, we
should rewind to intent-based leadership.
    Intent-based leadership began when Stephen Bungay1, historian, author,
and management consultant, took mission command concepts and reframed
them for the corporate context. Mission Command provides some
philosophical basis for how much of the West’s modern military functions and
is thought to have originated and evolved in the German army in the early
1800s under the leadership of Helmut Von Moltke and termed Auftragstaktik.
    From this, Bungay first coined the term “Leading with Intent”, while the
term “Intent-based Leadership” later followed, having been popularized by
David Marquet in his book, Turn the Ship Around. For the purposes of this
discussion, we could use the terms interchangeably.
    Intent-based leadership is a broad term, and that’s great. Leadership needs
to be broad. However, we saw other concepts that we wanted to slip
underneath the leadership umbrella, and intent-based leadership didn’t seem
quite expansive enough. We needed to take intent-based leadership and unfurl
it even wider than before. For example, we believed leadership should
encompass the concepts of building psychological safety, employee wellbeing,
building trust remotely, and even the pivotal work of Brené Brown2 and Amy
Edmondson3, which not only centers psychological safety but also orbits
concepts like team building, overcoming imposter syndrome, building genuine
connections, and more.
    All these things are well-known, even commonplace, in modern, effective,
people-forward working environments. However, are they thought of in an
integrated way? Are they considered holistically? Or are they piecemeal, a
variety of quality-of-life initiatives handed off to different teams that never
quite gel together or support one another?
    We believe that, when you bring all these things together, they have to be
combined and integrated in a systematic way. Just as the orchestra moves in
concert, all vital elements of good leadership must also find a rhythm. They’re
reading off their own sheet music, yet also looking to the conductor to ensure
they’re playing in the same key, and also actively helping each other regain
their tempo when someone or something inevitably misses a note. Constant
rehearsal has allowed them to act as part of a collective: individual and
independent, while also aligned with a greater purpose.
   We also needed a metaphor that would clearly communicate our intentions
and our vision of what great leaders should be able to accomplish. This had to
be done while grappling with the implications of Agile—capital “A” agile, in
this case—being increasingly commercialized and commoditized, broken down
into a collection of saleable concepts and buzzwords. We’re not objecting to the
idea of organizations paying good coaches to help their teams become more
agile. Rather, we have a problem with the buzzword being sold rather than the
underlying theory and practice, stripping away the original intention and agile
thinking behind it.
   Take, for example, servant leadership. In a nutshell, servant leadership asks
leaders to prioritize the greater good—their team, department, or organization
—over themselves. They put their own objectives aside and focus on the needs
of their direct reports. Sounds great. Until you dig a little deeper and consider
the implications. The two terms—servant and leader—will always be in
conflict. To serve is to be subservient rather than to work in concert with
others. Why are you hiring leaders at all if you’re not letting them lead? The
concept of servant leadership is a package of ideas that sounds great at a glance
and falls apart the closer you look at it. We think that what servant-leadership
intends to do is something akin to intent-based leadership, but it fumbled the
concept.
   You don’t need agilish concepts like Servant Leadership if you have strong
foundations in place. Hence, we conceptualized the first of the five stanchions:
Conductive Leadership.
Conductors? Like… Aluminum?
When we talk about conductors, people sometimes get tangled up in the two
primary definitions: a material that transmits heat, electricity, sound, etc.,
versus the leader of an orchestra. In fact, the two share Latin roots: conductus is
a carrier, while conducere is one who leads, brings others together, or serves. To
lead became to drag or push, and so we arrived at the idea of conducting water
through channels or power through cables. However, the idea remains the
same: conductors get everyone working at the same tempo and guide their
actions; however, they are ultimately in service to the larger team.
    Conductive Leadership follows the same principles. It asks leaders to help
teams synchronize and flow in the same direction. They don’t tell people how
to play their instruments (or GitHub repositories). They don’t rush into the
orchestra to demand metrics on strings-plucked-per-minute. They enable
people to play with autonomy but stand ready to guide people towards success
if they lose the beat or start playing off-key. They bring people together in
service of a larger purpose. Their role is to ensure harmony, to help the teams
come together to create something, a product, that an audience—a customer
—can love.
    At the end of a performance, the conductor takes a brief bow… before
turning to bow to their orchestra, those who made the music possible.
    In a business setting, Conductive Leaders focus not on elevating themselves,
but upon uplifting their team and facilitating their growth and success. They
build environments—in person, remote, or hybrid—that feel safe, supportive,
and collaborative. They encourage connection and experimentation, while also
acting as the bumpers in a bowling-rink, allowing their teams to bounce back
and forth while always staying on a trajectory towards shared goals.
    Shifting to a model of Conductive Leadership means a transition to a
number of new modalities. Let’s explore them one by one.
Leading with Intent
At its core, Intent-Based Leadership4 is about giving those you lead the
intrinsic motivation to love and succeed in their work. Create an intent for the
team, the department, the business, and invest everyone with that same intent
so that they’re motivated and excited to hit their goals and create value for
customers.
    This requires leaders to push autonomy outward: to people, teams, and even
other leaders. Give everyone the maximum possible ability to make important
decisions, while providing clear guide rails that ensure those decisions are in
alignment with the larger strategic vision. Those guide rails also let people
know when a decision needs to be escalated.
    Doing this requires leaders to address and understand what needs to be
communicated and reported in order for teams to operate well. That may
mean exploring synchronous versus asynchronous communication, increasing
transparency of information, and handing back time to leaders and teams by
eliminating meetings and micromanagement culture. This is especially crucial
in a hybrid or remote-work environment, where information cannot be shared
as easily. Conductive leaders must ensure all have the information they need to
do their jobs, while creating opportunities—virtual or otherwise—for their
team to connect, share, discuss, and align.
Cognizance and Responsibility
We want everyone in an organization to be aware of what’s expected of them
and what isn’t. What they can do with their autonomy, and where the
guardrails lie. What policies grant them freedom and what policies need to be
strictly adhered to.
    This ties in with the clear flow of information that comes with Intent-Based
Leadership and allows people to make important decisions without butting
their heads against policies they didn’t know existed. When everyone is aware
of the guide rails, they can operate faster and more freely inside those bounds.
    This also impacts upon the concept of trust. If we can’t trust our team to
take responsibility for their work—either because we don’t know our
teammates on a personal level, or they haven’t had an opportunity to
demonstrate their competence—we’re headed for trouble. Humans don’t
always trust easily, especially if they’ve had difficult encounters in the past. It’s
harder still in a remote-work environment, where interpersonal
communications are limited to text or the occasional video call. In these
situations, Conductive Leaders must first allow their team members to trust
them, by being transparent, reliable, and consistent in their actions,
communications, and approaches. Only then will team members open up,
become vulnerable, and begin to demonstrate what they’re truly capable of.
    Responsibility is a crucial topic to discuss in the context of Agile
Governance, because it’s fundamental to agility as a whole. It also sometimes is
mentioned in the same breath as accountability, so let’s take a moment to
clarify.
    An engineer is responsible for completing tasks. They owe this to their team,
their leaders, and their customers. Nobody is going to watch over their
shoulders to make sure the work is complete; it is their responsibility to
complete it to the highest possible level of quality. It’s important to understand
that responsibility can’t be given. It must be taken by the person in question,
willingly and enthusiastically.
    Accountability is concerned with what happens after the work is delivered
and is concerned with taking ownership over results and outcomes. If you’re
accountable for the work, you’re the one who takes the heat if the work doesn’t
reach expectations. Accountability for a project should generally be shouldered
by one person and one person only. In other words, the leader.
    A conductor is not responsible for playing the flute or plucking the harp.
They trust that responsibility to the members of their orchestra. They do,
however, become accountable for the overall performance of the orchestra.
When one member plays a bad note or loses time, the conductor guides them
back into alignment with the rest of the team. If half the orchestra is losing
time… well, we have to wonder whether the conductor has set proper
expectations or given their team the necessary training. If the performance is
terrible, the audience won’t be glaring at individual musicians. They expect the
conductor to be accountable.
    The lines between accountability and responsibility can be blurry. Leaders
are often accountable for their teams while also being responsible for work
handed to them by other leaders. It’s also easy to wonder whether the
differences between accountability and responsibility are purely corporate
semantics. How often do you hear the word “accountable” outside the office? Is
it purely a label for leadership responsibility? That’s a debate bigger than this
chapter.
    What’s important is this: people must have a sense of ownership and pride
over their work. Maybe their work is software engineering. Maybe their work is
teaching. Maybe their work is facilitating the work of others. Sure, we can
categorize these people into little boxes marked employees or leaders or coaches,
and we can discuss our expectations for them in terms of accountability or
responsibility. So long as we ensure everyone wants to do well, wants to perform
above expectations, wants to stand next to their work and say I did this, and I
own the results.
    It takes Conductive Leadership to create this environment: a place of
positivity and psychological safety, where everyone has a growth mindset and a
willingness to learn from failure. Without it, we very often see buck-passing,
excuses, or misunderstandings when it comes to taking the blame for mistakes
(but fewer misunderstandings when it’s time to gather accolades for successes.
Funny, that.)
   A question often raised at this point: who conducts the conductor? Who
ensures the leader feels safe and takes ownership over their outcomes? The
obvious answer: other leaders. But that’s a bit too simple. Leaders do not sit
outside the environment they create. If they build an atmosphere of
psychological safety for their team(s), they are also existing inside that
atmosphere. If they build ownership and responsibility throughout their teams,
they will find it easier to take ownership over the team’s outcomes.
Create Clarity of Focus
People can’t work freely and enthusiastically if the path ahead is foggy and
littered with trip hazards. Leaders can help conduct their teams by clearing
those impediments and providing a psychologically safe environment in which
people can ask questions, make mistakes, and work their way through the fog
without falling over their own feet. When we think about psychological safety,
we often think about it through the lens of the Aristotelian work Google
conducted in 2012 around what made their teams the most effective and
efficient. After years of research with over a hundred teams, they found that
understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving
Google’s teams—which norms mattered? They found it was about social
sensitivity, that anyone on the team was comfortable speaking up without
feeling embarrassed, punished, or blamed. That’s the essence of great agile
teams, and it’s the role of leaders to create that space. It’s essential to foster
clarity of focus: a clear view of the goal, the route, the resources required, and
the steps taken along the way. This is one of the hardest things to do for leaders
in complex modern organizations. The amount of volatility, uncertainty,
ambiguity, and complexity in our integrated world is actually growing when
we think about how we currently build and deploy customer solutions using
hundreds of Software as a Service (SaaS) products. Add to this the fact that we
are made up of hundreds and even thousands of individuals who are nonlinear
and unpredictable. The world is constantly offering endless opportunities and
challenges that need to be resolved to ensure the sustainability of our company,
which adds to the role and challenges for the leadership group: to be able to
cut through the noise of options and opinions and make information clear so
our people know what to do. How often do you find companies with
competing strategies and conflicting KPIs that cause confusion? On the one
hand, we don’t want to over-simplify, though we do need to make information
simple enough that people can make the right next decision. Clear strategies
that decompose to work and allow people to make decisions to head in the
right direction are critical to organizational success, and one of the
fundamental roles of the leader. Conduct people toward the right goal.
    This is a balancing act for leaders. Providing clear direction while also
allowing each member of the team space to find their own unique path can
take time. It’s especially difficult when the leader is expected to be invisible: a
conductive presence gently guiding people through complexities without ever
actually grabbing them by the hand. Good leaders set expectations, provide the
resources needed to reach those goals, and build frameworks for tracking
progress… and then let their teams walk the road. As 6th Century BC
philosopher Laozi5 said, “A leader is best when people barely know that he
exists, not so good when people obey and acclaim him, worst when they
despise him. Fail to honor people, they fail to honor you. But of a good leader,
who talks little, when his work is done, his aims fulfilled, they will all say, ‘We
did this ourselves.’”
Be Flexible and Adaptable
The needs of the team are always changing. Sometimes it’s the result of
evolutions within the workplace. Sometimes it’s due to shifts outside the office.
Remote-working or hybrid-work teams may engage with the work at different
hours, enjoy different holidays, observe different schedules based on cultural
and religious practices, etc.
   A rigid leader will force their team into a box full of checks, balances,
constraints, and iron-clad expectations… and in the process, utterly crush their
team. Conductive Leaders, on the other hand, must be flexible enough to
change ways of working to suit the needs of the team, and adaptable enough to
reshape their own assumptions and processes in order to get the best results for
customers and colleagues. A good Conductive Leader is always open to
exploring new approaches and technologies, and reflecting on how they can
best support their team, maximize collaboration, and boost productivity in
ways that suit their team’s unique needs and situations.
   Speaking of which…
Encourage Collaboration
This is important enough to get its own modality. Collaboration is king.
Without it, 21st century teams will collapse. Sharing ideas, brainstorming, and
trystorming, joining forces to work on passion projects… This is the heart of a
great team. It’s where people can achieve quick wins and build trust in one
another. Collaboration forges lifelong bonds, stronger than anything you can
create through isolated, siloed work.
   Good Conductive Leaders are proactive in creating collaboration
opportunities. If their team is hybrid or remote, they find online work
management platforms and run virtual brainstorming sessions. If everyone is
sharing an office, they do it in person. What’s vital is that they don’t wait for
collaboration to occur spontaneously. They build instances where teamwork
can flourish, and then nurture the results.
   What we find, particularly in large organizations, is that collaboration
doesn’t come naturally, especially when you take into account the remote
context in which large proportions of our people do not physically attend their
place of work, and as we often like to refer to: “in remote, silos become
chasms”. We don’t see each other enough to have the passing quick
conversation, the sideways nod, the ability to grab a coffee, or even just have a
chat about how things are going. There is an element of emerging data that
says, if you interpret it, that the burden on leadership has grown proportionally
larger with the distribution of the workforce because it becomes a role of the
leader to connect not only within their team but between teams. We often see
employee experience surveys that talk about great collaboration within a small
team, which then diminishes or disappears as it crosses team boundaries. The
ask of leadership is not only building collaboration within their team but also
finding the opportunities to allow this to emerge, provide benefit, and allow
decisions to be made faster and things to move forward.
   A great mechanism we have used in the past to find, encourage, and
enhance collaboration was created by Craig Brown—Collaboration in Eight
Easy Steps. We know about this model because we asked Craig to present it.
The key is starting with what you think good collaboration looks like, what
makes it better, and the maturity pathway. This pathway draws on the work of
Dr. Neil Preston and shows the ratio of collaborative maturity6 starting at the
bottom, where corruption lives, maturing to competition, compliance, and
collaboration, and ultimately ending in an environment where co-creation
thrives.
   Many organizations get to compliance and cooperation, rarely to
collaboration, and co-creation is still an emergent property. The leader’s role is
to take the organization as far up that ratio as possible to allow the
organization to benefit from the diversity of its people, their ideas, their
passion, and their determination.
Competency and Training
What falls underneath the umbrella of Conductive leadership is the
responsibility to ensure that all those people working underneath you have a
competency and that if there’s a gap in their competency then you are able to
enable them to succeed.
    We often talk about building capabilities through upskilling. What
employer doesn’t want their employees to build their skillset, deliver more
value to both the company and customers, and move sideways or upwards into
the positions most suited to their new talents?
    What we often sidestep (or sidle past, eyes averted) are the mechanisms for
helping people upskill, and who will take responsibility for guiding, delivering,
and verifying that growth in skills. We also don’t like paying for it. It’s not
uncommon that, when times get tight, the first budgets we cut are for further
training.
    The way we envision the concept of competency and training stems from
our experiences in the military; specifically, the way the military aggressively
pursues training across the rank and file. Competent militaries understand the
value of a highly skilled, highly motivated force who are always looking to
learn, and who (in the process of learning) understand how to pass those skills
on to those who follow in their footsteps. It’s a common saying in the army:
train hard, fight easy. If you’re not in the process of fighting, you need to be
training; when the fighting begins, you won’t have the opportunity to ask for a
time-out and get your troops fighting fit. You need those patterns and
heuristics to kick in automatically, or you’ll be going home in tatters.
    Yet, even as the world becomes increasingly VUCA and the fight for
customers and market share approaches the doorsteps of organizations all over
the world, leaders still aren’t being proactive and training their employees in
advance of those crises.
    When leaders do take training seriously, the results are fantastic. As we write
this, we’re preparing to meet with the portfolio team of a large-scale Global
Organization. They have time and resources budgeted for training, which
builds competencies across a broad sweep of teams. We expect that we’ll be
able to check on the team the week after training and ask, what do you now
know? What do you feel competent in? How can you demonstrate it? The
muscle memory will be built before the crisis arrives.
    That last point—asking how new skills can be demonstrated—is vital.
Ensuring that your people have the right skills and competencies to do the
work is an investment both in the individual and in the organization as a
whole, but those skills can’t just be on paper. Unless the teams also build
muscle memory—the ability to leap into action without thinking and put
those skills to use—then they may as well just be training manuals stored in a
nearby filing cabinet. Competency and training only become useful through
application. Plus, muscle memory spreads by osmosis. Skills learned by one
team will, over time, translate outward through an organization (but only if
you give people opportunities to demonstrate their skills in new situations and
with new people surrounding them). Just as individuals can build muscle
memory, so will teams and departments… We can even discuss muscle
memory on an enterprise and organizational level.
    Also of note, to continue our muscle-memory metaphor: when you first
learn an activity, your brain’s pre-motor cortex and basal ganglia light up as you
actively think through and problem-solve the activity for the first, second,
third… or even hundredth time. The more you demonstrate understanding
through application, the more that brain activity moves into the main motor
cortex and cerebellum, while the premotor cortex and basal ganglia take a rest.
In other words, thinking shifts from the active areas of the brain into the
automatic areas. We see the same in organizations: demonstrate mastery of a
skill a hundred times, and even if you put it to rest for months or years, the
organization will still retain that knowledge and be ready to spring into action
when the time is right.
    Building competencies is not limited to directly delivering work. Teams
must also become competent and trained in routines such as decision-making.
You can conceptualize the process behind becoming competent at decision-
making with something like the Cynefin framework, which gives users a solid
foundation or “sense of place” from which to view and evaluate their
perceptions. When a portfolio runs on repeatable processes, the decisions
commonly made within that portfolio are part of the standard operating
procedure. Thus, more abstract processes such as making decisions, resolving
tensions, or prioritizing WIP can be repeated, refined, evaluated, and become
part of the team muscle memory.
     We mentioned earlier that our experiences of competency and training have
military roots. Military personnel often find themselves in chaotic situations,
which corresponds with one of the four domains of the Cynefin framework.
Their mission is often to move through these domains—from Chaos to
Complex, then Complicated, and finally Clear—before making further life-or-
death decisions (a simplification, we know—gathering enough information to
move from Chaos to Complex is often, in itself, life or death).
     When a squad is caught in a Chaotic situation, it needs a number of things
if it’s to survive. Chief among those is the aforementioned muscle memory, and
the leadership required to chart a course out of the chaos. The leader decides
the direction of travel, the prioritization of tasks required to survive. However,
they don’t hold their squad’s rifles for them, or direct every bullet. They don’t
form a group huddle and prioritize their next steps on a Kanban board. The
situation necessitates intent-based leadership: the leader will say, I need you to
accomplish X and Y and my best information indicates you should begin by
heading to Z, but after that point, the leader must trust their people to get the
job done according to their training.
     So, we return to our original point: the responsibility for ensuring teams
have these competencies and are able to demonstrate them falls to the leaders;
however, Conductive Leadership implies that the leaders then need to stand
back and let the teams do the work. Leaders guide, uplift, and protect. They
don’t lean over their team’s shoulders or snatch away their keyboards when
things aren’t going according to plan—that demonstrates a lack of training for
both the team and the leader. Sometimes, in extreme chaos, the leader might
call a pause and make sure everyone is aligned with their larger objectives.
However, on the whole, there is a level of trust in the competence and clarity
of the individual.
Be Empathic
The ability to place yourself within someone’s frame of reference and to be
open and understanding regarding their concerns, struggles, and emotional
states, is essential for Conductive Leaders. We could also argue that it’s
essential for everyone to always be developing their empathy, but for the
purposes of brevity, let’s limit the conversation to leadership. Great leaders
understand and respond to the concerns of their team members. They listen to
the team’s needs and work to create an open, supportive environment in which
those needs can be shared and met.
   This is especially crucial in a hybrid work environment, where feelings of
disconnection or isolation are common. Conductive Leaders are proactive in
reaching out to their team, building opportunities to share and align, and
ensuring that everyone feels part of a greater, supportive whole… even if that
team is spread across continents and have never met in person.
Conductive Leadership is to Serve
Conductive Leadership asks leaders to abandon mechanistic approaches that
view people as cogs in a machine, and instead take a humanistic approach
where everyone’s individuality and creativity can flourish and guide the work.
    In large scale corporate environments, we rarely directly manage all the
people that are involved in the delivery of outcomes we are accountable for. We
don’t have any guarantee that the people have been put through a disciplined
training/induction process with military rigor, and we’re often managing
contractors and externals from completely different cultures. Mission
command is great when you have your own justice system and you can court
martial your “employees”, but corporate leaders don’t operate in remotely
similar conditions. Your primary job is not preparing for war, you’re in a
constant state of warfare in the marketplace and there’s no penalty for treason
if they jump ship to a competitor—and take your market IP with them. Yet,
we still need to get results from the efforts of thousands of people, and if you
think about Dunbar’s number, we can hold meaningful relationships with
about 150 of them. Theories such as intent based leadership work well in these
domains, and can transition with principles, yet in practice can be difficult to
meaningfully implement.
    We understand that this is easier said than done. It asks leaders to abandon
many of the things they’ve internalized as standard operating procedure in
management school or over years of traditional middle-management. It forces
them to become coaches and guides who support people’s growth, and replaces
preventative constraints with enabling constraints.
    Most of all, it requires growth. As per Jack Welch: “Before you are a leader,
success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all
about growing others.”7 Through Conductive Leadership, everyone has the
opportunity to extend themselves, to nurture themselves and others, to raise
up those around them.
   To be a Conductive Leader is to serve, enable, and to celebrate the successes
of others, and the whole.
