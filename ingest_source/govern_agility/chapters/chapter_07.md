## Chapter 7: Stanchion #2: Sensible Transparency

The Oxford dictionary defines agility as the ability to move quickly and easily.
     Dexterously? Adaptively? With purposeful intent? These are all vital aspects
of agility, absolutely. However, quickly is the first word, the most important
word. Without speed, agility collapses. That could refer to the speed of
decision-making, the speed of data gathering and processing, the speed of
reactivity…
     All of which relies upon Sensible Transparency.
     We’re all professionals here. We know how to gather information, how to
process and disseminate it. We know how to sit down with colleagues and
come to mutually satisfying decisions on direction.
     However, we can’t do those things at speed if traditional governance has
boxed us in with tall, impermeable walls. Those walls may be literal and
physical (the locational siloing of teams, information only being delivered face-
to-face), digital (restricted networks, teams dedicated to “amending” language
in internal communication), emotional (individuals feeling they can’t trust one
another, and therefore retaining crucial insights), inter-departmental (why
would sales need to know the engineering budget?), or any other number of
ways in which the flow of information is deliberately or unconsciously
restricted. Why do so many organizations build these walls? Adherence to
tradition? Maybe.
     Often, it’s not the organization but the individuals. Transparency is great,
but it also invites criticism. Share an idea; get a whack because someone thinks
it’s stupid or it’s been tried before. Share a report; get a whack because someone
doesn’t trust the data. Share a work product; get a whack because someone
could have done it better. It’s that “easy to criticize, hard to create” idea. Or, to
use a food metaphor, why food critics tend to make terrible chefs. There may
also be a fear that teams will lose effectiveness unless they’re only delivered
exactly the information required for their jobs.
     This is why, without Sensible Transparency, even the most progressive agile
organizations will struggle to reach their potential. We specify Sensible
Transparency here because many agile teams are great at being transparent.
They communicate well, share everything they know, and trust each other to
get the work done. However, when we zoom out and consider governance of
the system as a whole, we find obstacles everywhere.
     Sometimes this is deliberate. More often it’s an evolution of scarcity—when
we’re short on resources and time, we tend to put our heads down and focus
on the work. As such, communication only moves as far as the team we’re
working with. Other times, a lack of transparency can be a consequence of
operating models. Our functions are often optimized for strict hierarchies, so
the more we share outside our departments, the less efficient we become (at
least, in theory). We trust “us”, but we don’t trust “them”. How many times do
you hear of companies where people and performance scores show great team
collaboration, but increasingly less when expanding the boundary? That’s the
funny yet sad thing about tribes and western culture—tribes often go to war
with each other.
     Measuring and rewarding the performance of individual silos is another
obstacle to communication. When silos are competing, levels of collaboration
go down. We often see whole organizations with multiple unaligned,
conflicting, and competing strategies, which only serve to emphasize silos
across functions. And, of course, we have the rare occasions when information
scarcity is intentional. Why would somebody choose to withhold information
that could benefit their team, department, or organization as a whole? Maybe
it’s the inescapable specter of corporate politics. Maybe it’s about preservation
of status or an ego-centric view that knowledge equals power, while
dissemination of knowledge results in the dilution of that power. Sometimes,
an individual’s survival instincts can hurt those around them, draining their
sense of safety and security.
     Having seen the inside workings of countless companies over the years,
we’ve come to advocate for complete Organization Transparency regardless of
whether an organization is “agile” or not. Transparency of information, both
good and bad, increases speed. It removes ego and enables better decision-
making. It boosts trust. There’s no spin, no flimflam. Just the necessary facts,
available to everyone when and where they need them.
     Note: we say necessary facts. Not everything can and should be 100%
transparent. I’m sure you can name a hundred things within your team,
department, or organization that shouldn’t be shared openly. Esther Derby
provides a great insight into this in her Cutter Journal article Knowledge Is
Bifurcated1, where she describes the Zone of Transparency: a concept that refers
to the level of openness and honesty in an organization’s communication.
    This zone is the area where employees can speak freely about their opinions,
experiences, and concerns without fear of retaliation. This creates an
environment of trust and transparency, where individuals feel comfortable
sharing their thoughts and ideas. Creating and maintaining a zone of
transparency is crucial for organizations to identify and solve problems
effectively, build relationships, and foster a positive culture.
    Esther also describes the concept of “bifurcation of knowledge”. This relates
to the zone of transparency in that it recognizes the existence of two separate
types of knowledge in an organization: explicit knowledge, which is shared
openly and transparently, and tacit knowledge, which is not easily shared or
communicated. Bifurcation of knowledge acknowledges that explicit and tacit
knowledge are both essential for organizations to function effectively and
efficiently. Esther argues that organizations must strive to balance explicit and
tacit knowledge to achieve their goals and create a positive culture.
    In short, take the time to identify what information within your
organization, team, department, system, etc. is explicit and what is tacit, and
find ways to ensure they’re treated accordingly. If you can’t be transparent with
information, you can instead be transparent about what and why you’re unable
to share. To quote a text with significantly more pedigree than any agile text:
“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”2 Whether you’re
religious or not, you’ll often find wisdom in the classics.
    So, what does implementing Sensible Transparency actually mean? What
key imperatives do companies need to consider before diving in?
Transparency is Scary
We mean it. When people not used to complete transparency are immersed in
a culture where everyone shares, information is free, and collaboration is the
rule, they can become intimidated.
   Why? Isn’t transparency freeing? Sure, unless you make a mistake. Just as
cats cover their food when they’re anxious about predators, people become
anxious when they may be blamed for their innocent errors. Having the ability
to experiment, to raise questions or concerns, to make mistakes, and to grow in
understanding, all without being punished or humiliated, is known as
psychological safety. Project Aristotle—that two-year initiative launched by
Google to investigate high performing teams—identified this as one of the five
most crucial factors that helped teams excel.3
   Creating psychological safety in cultures that are pathologic or blame-based
generally does not encourage high performance. Instead, they encourage butt-
covering. What we need to go alongside our culture of transparency is a culture
of inquiry, of sharing, of interpreting failures through a lens of reflection and
improvement. Only then can we make transparency exciting instead of
terrifying.
Directional Decisions and Expedient Interventions = Limited
Information
This is a very broad statement, and you can probably recall instances where a
leader making a decisive intervention was for the ultimate betterment of the
team. However, a pattern of frequent directional decisions often betrays a
broken system, where mental models are rigid, information is limited to a few,
and the first response to complications is, “But this is the way we’ve always
done it.” Others rely on directional decisions because they’re afraid of getting
caught up in endless debate. Too many cooks spoil the broth, or so they say. A
single head chef saying this is the way is the route to success.
   We disagree. If collaborative decision-making is slow, it’s because not
everyone has enough of the relevant facts from the beginning. In today’s
complex world, if you wait for all the facts—or conduct extensive, up-front
analysis—the problems will have changed before you get started on the
solution. If mental models are rigid and the organization has always worked a
certain way, maybe you need to examine all the decisions that prior projects
took from start to “done” and ask whether those models are fit for purpose.
   Only when data becomes transparent, ubiquitous, and accessible can
decision-making become truly collaborative. More people with more
information and more freedom to speak their minds means more dynamic,
reactive decisions! While we can’t eliminate the occasional need for an
expedient intervention, true Sensible Transparency should help make decisions
easier, faster, and more aligned to the organization’s core mission. In fact, over
time, we want to see an increase in proactive decisions and actions based on
transparency of information, and less reactive firefighting.
   Which leads us to:
We Must Embody our Strategic Alignment
Every organization has a mission. Whether it lives up to that mission is a
different question. Sometimes, from the outside or even from inside
information silos, it can appear that everyone is rowing in the same direction.
Companies mail out glossy annual reports articulating the organization’s North
Star, or Southern Cross for those of us in the Antipodes, and all the progress
they’ve made towards achieving it—all in line with a pre-existing plan, of
course. Meanwhile, strategy may have gotten tangled behind closed doors.
    It’s easier to hide those situations when information isn’t being shared.
Much, much harder when practicing Sensible Transparency. High transparency
makes the links between vision, strategy, and execution immediately visible. It
helps to expose when we’re wandering off-track, and allows everyone to get
aligned, fast.
Bi-Directional Flow Makes Transparency Work
By which we mean, information needs to flow both ways. Or all ways. Not
waterfalling down on a need-to know basis, or being delivered through all-
hands meetings and mind-numbing PowerPoints, or being sent up from the
teams every month only to vanish into a black hole of management. We need
constant, asynchronous information flow going up, down, and sideways.
   It’s easy to imagine this sort of information flow becoming overwhelming.
Not so! Transparency means that people can access the information they need
when they need it and ignore the information that isn’t relevant to their goals.
   How will people know what information is relevant and what isn’t?
   A good question. Many organizations are now dealing with an explosion of
information larger than any single person or department can handle. Too
many insights and too many opportunities can be just as stifling and restrictive
as having too few. The need for fast progress often means moving forward with
imperfect information, and then adjusting the course based upon a constant
flow of relevant feedback. Handling this means organizations need to build
robust systems which can provide continuous feedback and analytics,
separating the wheat from the chaff. Doing so enables you to forge useful
insights from reams of raw data.
   It’s not always easy. However, we promise you: transparency through bi-
directional information flow is the easiest, fastest, and most cost-effective way
to make sure everyone knows what they need to, when they need to.
    Note: There’s often a trade-off to this. Transparency also invites fear—fear
of failure, fear of uncovering true issues that have hidden for years, and fear of
status and ego being lost. We mentioned earlier that transparency is a double-
edged sword. Sometimes you learn things that, in hindsight, you didn’t want to
know. However, to mix our metaphors, you can’t put the genie back in the
bottle. Instead, you must act with resolve and move forward.
    With all this in hand, let’s ask: who is responsible for creating Sensible
Transparency? Who has the ability to open up flows of information, or to
create conversations that draw people in both horizontally and vertically?
    The answer: leaders and managers. While everyone in an organization is
responsible for disseminating, interpreting, and collaborating, only leaders can
address the larger operating models that allow for accelerated information flow.
Only leaders can ensure everyone has access to what they need, when they
need it. Only leaders can work to reshape existing governance in a way that
supports and generates transparency. Leaders have the true power to change
the system via their decision-making and behaviors. We see time and time
again that although the people doing the work know what needs to change,
they don’t have the delegation, authority, or support to really attack systemic
concerns. That’s where the difference between leaders and managers is found.
Transparency is Where to Begin
If you want to make better decisions faster and accelerate the creation of value,
transparency is where you begin. Start sharing information more freely; even if
you’re not sure the data is 100% correct, if it’s enough to drive a conversion,
start a dialogue, or support an action, it’s worth the risk. Of course, it goes
without saying that this is limited; you don’t want to give away commercially
sensitive material or strategy if it’s not public. We don’t mean sharing Personal
Identifiable Information. However, we do mean information about internal
performance. If someone has joined your organization, signed their
employment agreement, then that’s generally enough for most information to
be shareable. As Dr. Alastair Cockburn once put it, “Internal collaboration is
not espionage.”
