## Chapter 14: Enabling Governance

In Chapter 13, we explored the final, most critical agile principle: “At regular
intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and
adjusts its behavior accordingly.”
   This, in our opinion, is key to the entire purpose and mindset of agility:
constant and continuous evolution. This is echoed in the opening line of the
manifesto: “We are uncovering better ways of developing software.”
   With the operative word being uncovering. To truly be an agile
organization, learning and adaptation must never stop. The world is VUCA,
change is constant, so governance should always be evolving.
   While the stanchions themselves are permanent fixtures, how you organize
around them to bring your own governance structure to life is where variability
emerges. In variability, we find opportunity.
   In this book, we’ve provided the overarching principles. We’ve explored
questions you can ask to interrogate the existing system and, we hope, build a
better one atop the bones of the old. However, the actual learning and growth
must be done by you, in your own context.
   Enabling Agile Governance in the Real World
   At this point in the conversation—with you, the reader, immersed in the
theory of Agile Governance and how the five stanchions can provide new
lenses through which to examine your organization—it’s tempting to begin
recommending specific techniques or processes that can move your
organization towards a culture and mindset of continuous improvement.
   We could list a million of them here, if we wanted. They’d all be useful in
one way or another. However, would they suit your organizational context and
help you become more dynamic and adaptive, or would they end up tying you
down to traditional governance methods?
   Our mission with Agile Governance (and with this book) has been to move
people away from traditional methods and governing mechanisms that
constrain their ability to become a dynamically adaptive organization. We want
your organization to be ready to adapt at pace, to make changes throughout
that are driven by the people closest to the work. We want to enable you to
adopt decentralized, autonomous decisioning underpinned by the five
stanchions. All of this is critical in a world of increasing complexity and
volatility, where the business landscape is changing faster than we can track.
    That sort of decisioning won’t happen if a central collective of decision-
makers are prescribing a set of rigid techniques.
    Yet, this is what we see all the time. Organizations know they need to be
more reactive to deal with a VUCA landscape, so leadership insists their teams
adopt methods X, Y, and Z regardless of whether they’re appropriate for the
team or customer. This is reactive demand management, often based on long-
cycle planning. Short-term changes appear agile, but if they’re still in service to
a larger plan they may not be appropriate for the organization’s needs, or
account for the internal VUCA. They look outward without reflecting inward.
    This sort of traditional governance is slow, bureaucratic, and usually based
upon heavyweight business cases focused on cost. Dynamically Adaptive
Organizations1, on the other hand, base their decisions on continuous value
flow. Their governance is fundamentally agile and distributed, so they’re able to
adapt in relevant ways and at the right speed to solve problems before those
problems change. They can experiment and innovate in tighter cycles, enabling
continuous improvement. They’re also aware of internal VUCA because they
take the time to reflect. Their changes are made to suit both external and
internal demands and they can choose and experiment with the processes and
techniques that best suit those specific needs.
    We can’t provide you with a checklist on how to make those changes, nor
should you expect leadership to either. Instead, make sure decision-making is
distributed to the people doing the work so they can uncover and implement
what best suits them and their organization’s needs.
    What we can do is give you some methods we have used and observed
being used successfully, methods that might be applicable to your particular
context.
    We have split these ideas into two core elements: the Heart; and the Hands.
Both are needed and have differing perspectives. It’s a little socio-technical, a
little mechanistic, a little humanistic, and a lot of being and doing.
    The Heart is about inspiring people, about the culture of the organization,
and about how you need to work with people to guide how they see, feel,
behave, and act towards the future. Embodying the why and taking people on
a journey
    The Hands are the processes, methods, and practices; they’re the actions
that are taken to move towards the goal. The ways of working and tooling that
enable better governance—the practical application you can see and do. Let’s
start with the Hands.
14.1 The Hands that Act
Go With the Flow
You already know that we consider data crucial to effective governance. We
wouldn’t have built an entire stanchion around it if we thought otherwise. So,
if you’re aiming to create a cycle of continuous improvement, your goal must
be to find new ways of applying data to the governance itself. This should serve
to elevate information around the governance’s performance and highlight
where that governance is improving.
    Use your own data. Gather it, analyze it, and use it to drive change.
Measure that change and reflect upon it to continually optimize your systems
of governance. Using Flow based principles is a great way to do this as when
adopted holistically it comes with an amazing set of powerful data and insights
that can be drawn from it.
    Which is easy to say. Maybe more complicated to put into practice. What
we’ve observed is that many leaders and organizations say that they’re data-
driven. They insist that they make data-driven decisions all the time. But once
you dig deeper, you find major decisions being made on gut feeling. Until you
break out of that mindset, it doesn’t matter what you measure or how you
analyze it. Your system of governance will never truly be optimized, and your
data will be wasted.
    If you’re serious about being data-driven, then don’t just pay lip-service.
Commit to it. Turn the lens onto yourself and be ruthless when it comes to
weeding out opinion-led decisions. If you find yourself reverting to opinion or
gut feeling, stop. Ask, do we have enough data to make this decision? If not, is
that why we’re reverting to our old ways? What do we need to measure? How
can we measure it? Refuse to move forward until you have the facts in hand.
Retrospect
Retrospectives are a well-trodden and well-understood technique in agile, and
are a foundational principle of continuously reflecting, learning, and evolving.
In fact, we’ve been fortunate enough to meet the people who wrote the book
on retrospectives: Diana Larsen, Esther Derby, and Ken Schwaber. We’d call
their book Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great2 an essential read,
especially if you feel your retrospectives aren’t helping to achieve measurable
change.
    A good retrospective is about learning and understanding. We’ve seen a lot
of fantastic retros in our time. We’ve also seen organizations where retros don’t
seem to lead to any positive change. We call these sorts of processes and rituals
“Forrest Gumps”, because we see people running, running, running endlessly.
You ask, where are you running to? They don’t know. Why are you running at
all? They don’t know. When are you going to stop? They don’t know that
either.
    This is a symptom we see in organizations where there’s a colossal amount
of pressure to achieve newer, shinier, bigger things. Retrospectives are
performed, yet nobody has the opportunity to reflect upon or apply the
learnings. Traditionally it would be the Project Implementation Review (PIR).
Usually at the end, post closure of a fixed planned initiative, to gather lessons
learned—which sit in a file somewhere that no one knows about, knows they
need, or can even find.
    If you want to improve your governance and systems of work, you need to
take the time in your retrospectives to breathe and ask, what’s working for us?
What isn’t? What can we improve, and how can we achieve it?
    Otherwise, you’ll end up with a lot of forward motion that gets you
nowhere, like chasing a mirage. You need to adopt a Kaizen-style mentality
that embraces continuous improvement rather than using retrospectives as a
checked box, and you can’t improve if you don’t know what needs improving.
    Interestingly, running in the same place for too long is doubly dangerous
because it gives you the illusion of stability. You might assume everything is
okay because at least you’re still performing at the same level you were twelve
or eighteen months ago. In reality, everyone else has raced ahead. Relative to
your competitors, and your customers’ needs, you’ve fallen well behind. In this,
business matches one of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics3: energy
will naturally bleed from a higher to a lower temperature object, but never in
the other direction. If you want to stay hot, and on the bleeding edge, you
need to inject fresh energy into the system.
    So, don’t be a Forrest Gump. Know where you’re headed, why you’re going
there, and how you’re going to improve, and do this all via retrospectives.
Kaizen
In case you missed it in earlier chapters: Kaizen is a Japanese term that means
change for the better. In agile terms, Continuous Improvement.
    Some people use Kaizen as if it’s a process or tool. We’d rather think of it as
a mindset and goal. We love the stanchions because they ask you to reflect
upon your systems of governance in a way that trends towards continuous
improvement. In other words, Kaizen is baked into the stanchions from the
ground up.
    Kaizen stands at the polar opposite of Kaikaku; also Japanese and meaning
radical change. Big Bang changes that are radical in scope, speed, and level of
disruption have their time and place, but they’re not what the Kaizen
philosophy is all about. We’d rather ask, what’s the next problem we can
identify? How can I plan for it, begin the process with potential solutions,
check the efficacy of those solutions, and then act upon what I know? (AKA,
the Deming cycle). How can I create a mindset and vision for continuous
evolution that keeps not just myself or my team, but the entire organization,
working through that cycle?
    We’ve worked with a number of organizations that wanted to nurture this
sort of thinking. They tried, once or twice. However, since it didn’t work the
first time, it didn’t stick. What did we do wrong, they asked?
    The answer is most often, “You stopped.”
    These organizations wanted continuous evolution minus the iterative
process. They want to cut out the messy parts: the failures, learning, growth,
changes in shape, improvements, more failures, more learning, and so on. They
want the copy and paste formula applied to organizations, often found in a
glossy 400 slide PowerPoint presentation provided to solve your problems.
    We see this in other areas, too. In leadership, or in the restructuring of
systems of governance. A once-off effort that achieves part of what it set out to
do and is then left to stagnate.
    That’s not Kaizen, and it’s certainly not effective. Our five stanchions, on
the other hand, are all about making informed, incremental changes. And
then, as soon as one change is acted upon, moving on to the next. And the
next. And the next.
    We understand that, when it comes to governance, a lot of continuous
evolution is constrained by regulation. Various regulatory bodies will arrive and
ask for you to show them your controls, your processes. To do this, you must
define those processes. And with every process that’s rigidly defined, you lose a
fraction of flexibility.
    We’ve already shared our feelings on whether regulators are the great enemy
of improvement (they aren’t); however, they do require us to think in different
ways about what regulations are and how governance functions. Regulation
can either guide us towards new solutions or crush creativity and innovation.
    You want to enable the former.
    So, to create a Kaizen mindset and environment, you need to make sure
your teams have the skills and knowledge required to operate in an agile way
inside the guide rails of regulation. That means uplifting your risk assessment
frameworks and control frameworks in an ongoing manner to improve upon
them, and as you learn new information. Risk assessments and control
frameworks are important tools when thinking about how to govern a system,
and while we won’t explore them in-depth in this book, we strongly
recommend you integrate them into your patterns of work.
Heart of Agile
Dr. Alistair Cockburn, one of the authors of the Agile Software Development
Manifesto, developed The Heart of Agile (HOA), which is a fantastic tool for
considering how you can improve and adapt. Using the HOA’s four guiding
principles—Collaborate, Deliver, Reflect, and Improve—you can examine
your organizational constructs against the Stanchions to start making changes
and then use them to continually evolve and change in a considered manner.
   We’ll briefly explore these four principles.
   Collaborate: In order to grow trust and motivation, and accelerate the flow
of information, collaboration needs to be improved. To do this, we look to
improve the collaborative connective tissues that allow information to flow
horizontally, vertically, and bi-directionally. This in turn creates a culture of
transparency and, ultimately, trust. This enables you to implement Agile
Governance, its directional decisions, and elevates your ability to deliver
outcomes.
   Deliver: The ability to make expedient and informed directional decisions
means that in governing your system of work you can focus not only on
delivering incrementally, early, and often for early value, but also enables you
to deliver and create learnings for continuous improvement.
  Reflect and Improve: Provide an essential way to examine your
Collaboration and Delivery based on the data and information generated from
delivery. Reflecting and improving are inextricably entwined and often thought
of as the same act. However, many organizations simply jump to improving
without stopping to examine and understand the context. Therefore, the Heart
of Agile separates them to ensure focus.
   Reflect: Data is examined, whether subjective or objective, through data
analysis. Reflection is used because it can be a combination of retrospection,
known and used so well in agile, and introspection. Actual insights are
generated to fuel improvement.
   Improve: Based on those insights, rapid learning (probe, sense, and
respond) is used to understand and create effective actions. Those actions are
then used to adapt the governing of your systems of work.
Remote:af®: Remote Governance System
As we wrote earlier, we used the concepts of the Stanchions to create the
“Pillars of Remote Governance” for Remote:af.
   The Remote:af team have worked with Esther Derby to co-create a “remote
governance system”. This system provides leaders and organizations with a way
to understand and identify meaningful ways to evolve and enable the way they
govern their organizations.
   The “remote governance system”© is made up of a set of modules that
leverage patterns, tools, and exercises that have been developed using the
Esther Derby SEEM© model and Remote:af governance patterns.
   The system uses a set of principles, structures, and patterns that enable
leaders to navigate the governance system and explore unknowns in order to:

![Figure](images/page-009.png)


          understand and identify meaningful ways to evolve the system of
      governance as a whole within your own context;
         increase the zone of transparency in a rational way;
         purposefully adjust leadership for remote spaces;
         create the collaborative linkages that enable information flow;
         leverage data for dynamic analysis and decision-making;
         establish the basis for trust in remote/hybrid spaces.

  If you’re feeling stuck at the beginning of your Agile Governance journey,
we highly recommend taking a look at the Remote:af system and how it can
support you. Start your exploration at https://www.remoteaf.co/tool/improve-

   Now we move on to the Heart.
14.2 The Heart that Guides
Empowerment
To create a culture of continuous improvement, you need everyone in an
organization to have a certain degree of power. They need the capacity to
reflect upon their work, processes, and relationships with governance, as well as
the ability to make changes where necessary that better serve customers and
colleagues.
    The problem is that traditional governance concentrates decision-making
authority in a few select individuals, and then places those individuals at the
head of a top-down structure. It is, by definition, disempowering.
    The alternative approach is to create distributed, participatory governance.
This does more than put decision-making in the hands of more people. It turns
those people into a broad range of stakeholders. It empowers a greater selection
of people to get more granular in their planning and execution and increases
their investment in the process and outcomes.
    So, how can we empower people to make these decisions and become more
invested in outcomes?
    The answers lie, as before, in the stanchions. We start with information
flow: both horizontally and vertically through the connective tissues of the
organization. Without that flow, people can’t make decisions. Restrict that
flow, and you disempower them. We also see that disempowered people are less
likely to share information in the first place. This creates further risk by
strangling the flow of data. Traditional project milestones, quarterly reporting
approaches, steering committees, and so on take information sharing away
from teams and concentrate it in the hands of leadership. The result: by the
time leadership realizes something is wrong, it’s too late to change and adapt.
    Empower your people. Give them a reason to invest in customer outcomes.
Allow them to communicate in the ways that they need. All of this will enable
greater agility in your governance and create the environment necessary for
continuous improvement.
Customer Centricity
Customer expectations are already continuously improving, or at least,
continuously evolving as improvement is in the eye of the beholder. However,
the rise of customer expectations and demands has not always been in lockstep
with organizations realizing their need to be more customer-centric. We’ve
already talked about how companies must ensure their decision-making
processes are customer-centric, lest they fall behind or collapse entirely. That’s
why our entire approach to the five stanchions is customer-driven, and we
recommend aligning your governance to customer needs if you want to always
be growing and improving.
    Some organizations struggle with this paradigm shift. They’re stuck in a pre-
Copernican mindset of still believing that the customer revolves around the
business. They expect the customer to come to them, bowing and scraping, as
opposed to bringing their services to the customer. When you tell them to
adjust their worldview, they get angry. Remember that Copernicus was reviled
during his lifetime by Protestant protestors, who refused the notion that the
earth revolved around the sun… and sixty years after his death, the Catholic
Church took action against his publications. Yet, Copernican theory is now a
fundamental tenet of astronomy.
    In the same fashion, organizations that refuse to recognize the necessity of
customer centricity are wasting their breath and losing customer share. Only
by examining how you engage with your customers and meet their needs can
you gain the competitive edge needed.
    So, if you want to make strides towards Agile Governance, start with your
customers. What aspects of your governance serve them, and which serve
yourself? Which advances in technology and information sharing help your
customers to make informed choices, and which keep them in the dark?
    If in doubt, choose the customer. If you can’t meet their needs, reflect upon
your governance processes and experiment until you can. That’s the true
impetus behind continuous improvement.
Technology and the Art of Living Digitally
All of the new ways of working and governing explored in this book are only
possible because of radical advances in technology. Many software platforms
and solutions we now consider standard parts of the office suite have only seen
widespread adoption since 2020, and it’s that technology that has allowed us to
effectively gather and leverage data and insights. In short, our technology
platforms are already continuously evolving, for better or worse. It’s up to us to
keep pace.
    That’s why our approach with the stanchions embraces technology-driven
governance that allows us to make informed decisions more effectively. The
faster and more informed our decisions, the better we’re able to break out of
the loop of extended, centralized decisioning cycles. We must break out of
those cycles if we want to create effective governance.
    The problem is that many organizations don’t realize they’re trapped in
these cycles. They adopt traditional processes—often driven by traditional
technology—that pile up and pile up until they form a tower of rubbish
functioning less as governance and more as a form of organizational duress.
    To continue with the tower of rubbish analogy, do you know what happens
when garbage decomposes? It generates methane. Poison. No wonder
organizations struggling beneath the weight of traditional systems and
technology struggle to retain their best talent. How can culture flourish when
everyone is breathing poison? How can you blame talent for leaving when they
see other organizations adopting new technologies that replace the rubbish and
cleans the air?
    Traditional governance simply doesn’t align with the expectations and
preferences of the modern workforce, or the technology they use on a day-to-
day basis. Employees value autonomy, transparency, and purpose. This is a
generational shift that’s quantifiable through data.
    Technology is in a state of continuous evolution, whether you adopt it or
not. The needs and expectations of potential talent are evolving to match.
You’ll need continuous evolution within your own organization if you don’t
want to fall behind.
Cultural Evolution or Revolution?
We just mentioned generational changes in how new talent perceives their
work, goals, technology, and the relationships they require with leadership and
governance.
   This is the essence of the fifth stanchion, Humanity as the Cornerstone. To
place people at the heart of your governance and decision-making is to
acknowledge that people are always in a state of continuous evolution. The
needs of your customers, teams, and stakeholders, are always growing and
changing. Organizations that embrace this and, in turn, embrace alternate
governance methods such as what can be achieved via the five stanchions, can
create a more inclusive and empowering culture that attracts the best talent of
the day.
    This is the reality of culture. An organization can try to create a culture—by
allowing or disallowing certain behaviors and mindsets—but it will also form
dynamically based upon the methods and processes you use, the standards you
embody, and the ways in which you govern. When you use traditional
methods of command and control, you’re unlikely to foster a modern,
inclusive culture that can self-direct and self-govern.
    Traditional governance may also deny these evolutions in culture and the
support they need to thrive. The first fish to flap their way out of the sea
almost 400 million years ago probably would’ve appreciated a hand off the
beach. They would’ve resented leadership gently nudging them back into the
surf because deadlines were too pressing to experiment with breathing on land.
    This is why we believe the first step in fostering the sort of culture that can
thrive in a VUCA world is to disseminate control. However, this comes with a
caveat: when you take control away from traditional leadership, they can only
respond by reaching for the command lever. As such, disseminating control
and disseminating command come hand in hand. You can’t foster continuous
evolution if leadership is always kicking fish back into the sea.
    This is not an exhaustive list of techniques that can be employed in the
service of creating better Agile Governance. They are, however, a solid
foundation. You need both Heart and Hands to be successful.
    The only step left is for you to dive in yourself.
