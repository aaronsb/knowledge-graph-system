## Chapter 2: VUCA and the Modern World

Consider the world as it is today—economically, politically, technologically,
and culturally. How much of a resemblance does it bear to the world of twenty
years ago? How about ten years ago? Five? Two?
   We used to be able to draw clear lines between decades marking major
social shifts. Picture the eighties: a decade of excess, hard rock, huge hair, and
the fall of the Berlin Wall. The 90s was a return to counterculture, the dotcom
boom and bust, Tamagotchis and Y2K fears. But the 2000s? That’s when it gets
harder to pin down. As for the 2010s and ‘20s, it feels more and more like
we’re squeezing a decade’s worth of innovation and industry upheaval into
every eighteen months.
   Demand for change is accelerating beyond our capacity to keep pace.
Industry environments used to be stable for four to five years—enough time to
read the market, set out a three-year plan, and execute it. Nowadays, you’d be
lucky to get six months of stability regardless of your industry. This aligns with
what we learned while working with the inestimable Rob Thomsett in the mid
2000s, not long after he wrote the book, Radical Project Management. This
book introduced the idea of eXtreme Project Management, and the concept of
a shortening “window of stability”, which describes the narrowing range of
time you have before a previously defined problem changes into something
new. It used to be that you had three to four years to understand, analyze,
design, and build a market-ready solution to a problem. Now the problem
changes before the original solution is even deployed.
   This is why the market has often already moved on by the time a product is
launched. The public have abandoned brand loyalty—they demand new and
shiny innovations, improved services, and better prices, and they’re nimble
enough to shift providers on a whim. Brands still have power and presence, yet
this can be undone in the blink of an eye with a data release that compromises
customer privacy and security. For an example, see the class action lawsuit
brought against Australian health insurance organization, Medibank Private, as
a result of private customer information being leaked1.
    We once believed the earth was the center of the universe, until Copernican
theory redefined how we saw ourselves in relation to the sun and stars.
Likewise, the days of the customer coming begging to the organization are
over. The world no longer revolves around the organization; the customer is
the new center of the universe and the organization needs to come to them2.
    What happened to make the world this way? We could point our fingers at
any number of culprits. Technological advances are the most obvious cause:
global digitalization, the rise of artificial intelligence, and industrial
robotization have accelerated every aspect of industry. As this evolved,
customers have accelerated their expectations in turn, and in fact their
expectations now transcend industries. On the other hand, we face a series of
constant, overlapping and intersecting crises that make it harder and harder to
meet these needs: climate change, financial crisis after financial crisis, the rise
and fall of global superpowers…
    Add all these factors together and you have a world that’s increasingly
VUCA: Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous.
    We can’t go any further without laying the groundwork on VUCA: where
the term comes from, what it means beyond the acronym, and how it affects
the way we work and govern.
    VUCA was first used in the mid-80s by economists and university
professors, Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus, to describe the challenges and
consequences of external factors upon corporate leadership3. If only they’d
known how much more VUCA things would become over the following
decades!
    VUCA then became used by the US Army War College to describe the
political, social, and military environment after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. The old-world order of predictable cause and effect behaviors was gone.
Prisoner swaps on Berlin’s Glienicke Bridge were swept away in an
overwhelming wave of Perestroika and Glasnost.
    In the early 2000s, VUCA once again found a foothold outside the military.
With the fears and doubts of Y2K in the rear-view mirror, tech development
and big data accelerated. With that acceleration came fresh challenges in an
exponentially complex and interdependent world.
    The foot never lifted from the pedal. VUCA is everywhere. Go to any agile
or ways-of-working conference and every speaker will kick off their
presentation with a spiel about the world being a VUCA environment (in fact,
we do it all the time). When consultants roll into your organization to tell you
why you need another agile transformation, what they will likely follow with
is, “You need to be able to thrive in a VUCA world.”
   Let’s break VUCA down into its component parts:
   V = Volatility: the nature and dynamics of change, and the nature and
speed of change forces and change catalysts.
   U = Uncertainty: the lack of predictability, the prospects for surprise, and
the sense of awareness and understanding of issues and events.
   C = Complexity: the multiplex of forces, the confounding of issues, no
cause-and-effect chain and confusion that surrounds organization.
  A = Ambiguity: the haziness of reality, the potential for misreads, and the
mixed meanings of conditions; cause-and-effect confusion.
    In a VUCA environment, each of these four elements can present in
different ways and intensities. They can intersect, interact, and amplify one
another. They can manifest slowly over time or disrupt an entire industry with
the subtlety of a brick through a window. VUCA can be intrinsic, inside your
organization, as well as extrinsic, outside of it. Just as a global market can be
volatile, uncertain, complex, or ambiguous, so can your own internal processes,
relationships, departments, funding, confidence levels, and so on.
    A simple way to visualize VUCA is by considering taking a group of friends
out for lunch. If we need to drive, that could mean a lot of traffic, increasing
complexity. The weather is growing increasingly foggy, making the driver
uncertain. The passengers want to know when they’ll get there… but where is
there? Nobody knows where they want to eat, or even what’s available.
Ambiguity is high. Since everyone wants to get there immediately, the car is
always accelerating. Any little twitch of the wheel could result in a loss of
control. This volatile situation will require steady hands, the ability to read the
ebb and flow of traffic, a deep understanding of how the car functions (and
how far it can be pushed before it loses traction or explodes), and a readiness to
adapt to the changing needs of the passenger. An experienced driver, practiced
and disciplined in their approach, is able to better adapt to the changing
conditions. A newly licensed driver, or one with a fixed approach to operating
a vehicle, may not be able to make the changes necessary to meet those
conditions.
    Just like our hypothetical driver, organizations must prepare to make fast
decisions and respond to the events and boundaries that arise from VUCA
environments. This is especially important when thinking about governance.
Traditional and fixed governance are typically designed to be efficient and
effective in stable, predictable environments. In a VUCA world, traditional
governance freezes like a kangaroo in the headlights.
    However, the same factors causing some governance models to panic and
seize up will allow other models to succeed. Take information flow, for
example. This acceleration in change has caused an explosion in available data
and information. Ironically, traditional governance models are drowning in
data yet don’t have the technology, time, or skill sets to generate useful insights
from it. That’s doubly frustrating for those who crave certainty and detail
before moving forward. However, for those who can make sense of that data,
who can pick those insights out of the information soup, who can take small
steps forward while waiting for the fog to clear—they have the capacity to not
just survive, but to thrive.
    When it comes to making sense of this VUCA environment, we often begin
with the Cynefin Framework. We’ll dive into this framework in greater detail
later in the book, but for now all you need to know is that the Cynefin
Framework4 acts as a guide to support leaders, and sense the environmental
context they are in. This helps them make better decisions using models that fit
the problem they are trying to solve. There are five specific contexts in which
leaders need to learn how to act appropriately5:
                                                           6

    Chaotic: where everything is upside-down. Complete disorder and
unpredictability reigns, and the priority is to stabilize the situation,
establish constraints, and then transition the problem to one of the
other, less chaotic domains.
   Complex: where problems are dynamic and unpredictable, and the
cause-and-effect relationship behind those problems is not immediately
apparent. In this context, the focus shifts from analysis to
experimentation and adaptation, where we probe, sense, and respond to
emergent patterns.
     Complicated: where problems are more intricate and require
expertise to analyze and solve. This domain calls for the input and
support of experts, and solutions may involve multiple perspectives,
research, and analysis.
    Clear: also known as the Simple domain, problems here are well-
defined and have clear cause-and-effect relationships. The best approach
is to apply known best practices and standardized processes to achieve
       predictable outcomes.
           Confused: also known as Disordered. Confused is a state that can
       exist in any of the other domains. It implies we don’t actually know
       which domain we are in or how to approach a problem. It is crucial to
       recognize when you are in a state of Confusion and to take the necessary
       steps to shift to a more appropriate domain.

    Using a framework like Cynefin helps us navigate a VUCA world. It
becomes possible to better understand the nature of problems and distinguish
between those which may already have tried and tested solutions and problems
for which there may be no existing solutions. In these cases, it’s often more
effective to probe, sense, and then respond to the problem; to learn by doing.
We know that in the digital age, it’s the organizations that learn the fastest that
will succeed. Cynefin provides us with a path from the unknown to the
known, and gives leaders the tools to move problems between domains until
they can efficiently solve them repeatedly.
    Frameworks also help us place ourselves within these environments,
providing a better understanding of which forces we can influence, which we
can’t, which methods we can retain, which need to change, and so on.
    Just as the car traveling at breakneck speed down a foggy highway can solve
its problems incrementally (slow down a little! turn on the high beams! explore
the passengers’ needs to better orient yourself toward a destination!),
organizations can do the same. However, we can’t just adjust our traditional
governance models to make them VUCA-ready. There’s no amount of
tweaking that will make these models future-fit.
    Traditional governance models are designed for a clear world where best
practices and constraints are used as effective solutions to known problems.
How can you apply best practices before you have a solution or, in some cases,
before you’ve even defined the problem? These complex, chaotic worlds
demand a more nimble (or, could we say, agile?) approach.
    This is where the distinction between investing time and effort into agile
ways of working and Agile Governance becomes more pronounced. Many
organizations, when embracing a move to agile ways of working, dive in
without considering the broader picture. They break people out of their
boundaries into new constraints like tribes, squads, etc. and hand down new
ways of working to their employees without giving them the time to get to
know their new teams or decide how they want to work. They copy agile
models from other organizations without understanding the context that made
those models successful. Most critically, they fail to address the tension
between these new ways of doing the work and existing ways of governing the
work. They forget that the models they are seeking to emulate have evolved
from years, if not decades, of learning and adaptation. However, it’s hard to sell
decades of learning and adaptation as the solution, so…
    The result: agile(ish) teams trapped in an old governance system that limits
transparency and devalues trust. Teams ready and willing to adapt to changing
markets being forced to work according to monthly status reports. Innovators
constrained by top-down decision-making having to write investment cases to
free funds for solutions to problems they have barely defined. In these
situations, leadership will see control of the environment slipping through
their fingers (as agility by its very nature is designed to disseminate control)
and often respond by amplifying the worst of those old methods in order to
claw back their authority. The harder you push, the harder the system pushes
back7. This is only amplified in VUCA environments, where the natural
response to uncertainty is to tighten the reins by upping governance.
    Why are leaders so keen to respond to VUCA situations by increasing
controls instead of investigating the root causes, and using agility to solve their
foundational problems? One theory is that much of our management attended
the same schools and universities, emerged with the same training, and created
a systemic tendency towards certain patterns of thinking. Today’s leaders
largely learn the same principles that emerged from Taylorism, the principles
or practice of scientific management and work efficiency as practiced in a
system known as the Taylor System. This system remains a staple of MBA
courses. Taylorism has now rebranded itself as Six Sigma, Business Process
Engineering, and so on, however, the underlying principles are the same: a
focus on precise mechanical control of human endeavor to optimize for
physical labor.
    Another perspective is that we get so myopic in large organizations—we
navel gaze, tending to see a different ecosystem and performance than external
viewers—that we lose sight of what good looks like. We become unable to
interpret the weak signals that are all around us as information for decision-
making, or we don’t even have access to this information. In fact, there is so
much information and so little time that we don’t know which signals to
respond to and how, so we put more controls in place. We do this so frequently
and build so many layers of controls that nobody even understands why they
are used other than simply because that is how they have always been used. We
follow processes and tools over individuals and interactions; the agile order is
flipped.
    Career transformation coaches hit identical failure points across multiple
organizations and industries, wherein asking the leadership group to change is
a steeper challenge than changing the organization as a whole. There is also a
(valid) school of thought that many people crave certainty. Uncertainty is
uncomfortable, and many struggle to hold themselves in that state, even if in
the pursuit of something important to them. We have seen this emerge even in
the most confident and experienced leaders, where being trapped in
uncertainty quickly becomes unbearable.
    We often blame the system for rejecting change, but the system is just a
collection of humans working towards a common goal, and all those humans
want to survive.8 Leaders are faced with an unenviable choice: alter their
behavior to match the emerging needs of their increasingly autonomous teams
or meet the rigid demands of legacy governance frameworks.
    Adapting yourself to the system is sometimes a pathway to organizational
survival. Added to this are the overall demands and burdens on leaders, which
have grown exponentially over the last few decades. The often-conflicting
priorities and directions, regulations and customer expectations, never-ending
threats and opportunities, as well as the explosion in cyber challenges, artificial
intelligence, and technology revolutions, make it impossible to keep pace with
a working understanding of all these concepts at once. Yet, our systems
demand that our leaders do so, and we wonder why burnout and mental
health issues are on the rise.
    These leaders are working within a rigid system that refuses to see itself as
the problem. As per Maslow’s Law of the Instrument: “I suppose it is
tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were
a nail.”9 Traditional governance is the hammer, and when things go wrong, the
typical response is to first blame the nail (or screw, or drill-bit) and then fetch
more hammers.
   This brings us back to the need for new governance models. Agile ways of
working are insufficient in a VUCA world unless framed by a more holistic,
systemic governance approach designed for an organization’s specific context,
where leaders are willing to step away from tradition and embrace novelty. We
need lightweight, dynamic, and adaptive systems that provide faster feedback
in risk and compliance; flexible models that are willing to start small and
welcome change.
   Let’s put the hammer down. Better yet, let’s buy a whole new toolbox.
   Let’s talk about Agile Governance.
