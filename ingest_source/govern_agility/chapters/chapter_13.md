## Chapter 13: Don’t Stand Still

Through our time spent developing the Agile Governance model and
the five stanchions, a common question we ask ourselves is: what’s the
final purpose of this work? What is agility’s endgame, and the
endgame of Agile Governance?
   The answer lies in the original Agile Manifesto. For example, we
look to principle #10: “Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of
work not done—is essential.”
   Good governance should create an environment where people are
productive, engaged, and feel a sense of ownership, while also
protecting those people, their shareholders, and external
stakeholders from harm. It should strip away the non-essentials so
that driven professionals can spend their time on what truly matters.
These theories are not new—in fact, they have been at the heart of
Lean thinking since the formulation of the Toyota Production
System. Bad governance is a collection of competing principles and
regulations that function as effectively as a bag of snakes. Good, Agile
Governance should be simple and understandable. In fact, the more
we simplify over time, the better our governance becomes. There is
always the risk of oversimplification, and although we seek to remove
waste, we must be wary of simplifying so much that we create
untenable risk. There is always a balance required.
   We’re also big fans of principle #9: “Continuous attention to technical
excellence and good design enhances agility.”
   Most organizations are used to pursuing technical excellence and
good design in their development teams. At least they say they are,
and it comes as a sticker on the package when you buy the goods. We
want to normalize pursuing technical excellence and good design in
our governance. The tools we use to measure and analyze, to
communicate and enable, or the design of systems and spaces that
build transparency and collaboration, are all an end-goal of good
governance. So, take that principle and apply it more broadly.
    There is one principle that underpins and elevates all others. Not
the icing on the cake, but the flour that binds the cake together.
Specifically, the final principle: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on
how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.”
    This concluding principle, in our opinion, is key to the entire
purpose and mindset of agility: constant and continuous evolution.
This is echoed in the opening line of the manifesto: “We are uncovering
better ways of developing software.”
    We are uncovering. Not we have uncovered. To be agile is to always be
exploring, discovering, and improving. This, we feel, is the true
endgame of agility. Terminology, processes, and tools… can and will
change shape over time. But the core of the matter—to continuously
reflect, learn, grow, and evolve—is pivotal.
    It also starts with we, not us or you. This is critical, and when we
think about good governance, it always has an element of distributed
governance. Everybody within the system must play a part in ensuring
that the principles, practices, and processes put in place are able to be
executed by the people. This builds trust. Risk is a good example of
this: most organizations will have the concept of first, second, and
third-line risks, each managed by a different set of employees. The
first line (or, in military parlance, the front line) are people specifically
named as risk managers. They have a key role and responsibility, and
they know it. By the time you get down to the third line, you’re often
referring to people for whom managing risk is a part of their
responsibility but not specifically defined as their role. These are the
people you often need to empower within your organization to
deliver customer outcomes. As such, the risk they manage is no less
important. Risk must be approached as an “us” issue, or trust won’t be
an “us” concept.
   Continuous evolution is more than a recipe for improvement. It’s
also a survival principle. Long before agility was a common term in
business theory, the same principles were being applied by industry
greats. Toyota manufactured textile looms before they broke into the
automotive industry. Kiichiro Toyoda, son of Toyoda Loom Works
founder Sakichi Toyoda, was an innovative engineer who
experimented with and embraced steam, oil, and electric looms.
When their factory was robbed and their groundbreaking designs
stolen, Kiichiro said: “The thieves may be able to follow the design plans
and produce a loom. But we are modifying and improving our looms every day.
They do not have the expertise gained from the failures it took to produce the
original. We need not be concerned. We need only continue as always, making
our improvements.”1
   In 1937, Kiichiro Toyoda would take the family business in new
directions with the founding of Toyota Motor Corporation. A
continuous evolution mindset propelled a small but successful loom
manufacturer into the annals of history.
   This is where we hope the five stanchions of Agile Governance can
take you, as well.
   This principle of continuous evolution is expressed in the term we
chose to describe the five essential cores of Agile Governance:
stanchion. A stanchion is not a concrete pillar or a piece of
foundation. It’s a sturdy, upright fixture that supports other objects
until they can become fixed in place. Could you use a stanchion as a
permanent fixture? Sure, if necessary. We’d love to see the stanchions
as strong enough to always support you and your organization in
reaching your shared objectives. But, ultimately, the shape of the
stanchions suits the need. You don’t build a house to fit the shape of
pre-existing scaffolding; you put up the scaffolding to suit the home.
   In fact, our understanding of the stanchions is continuously
evolving as well. Yes, we’ve put them into practice at multiple
organizations—and to great effect. We’ve also had the opportunity to
reshape them in different contexts, like our time at Remote:af. All of
these experiences served to show us just how much we don’t yet
know, and how much room the stanchions have to grow.
   We’re not the only ones who can grow the five stanchions. You can
too. How you adapt them, incorporate them, and customize them to
suit your goals and the goals of your organization, is what brings
them to life. The variability of how you apply the stanchions is what
allows them to be properly harnessed to create value and
opportunity. In fact, that variability is the heart of the stanchions, and
of agility. The freedom to adapt, learn, and grow the ways in which
you apply the stanchions is what will give your governance longevity
and strength.
   That’s why we propose you think of the stanchions not as a strict
model to be followed, but as a collection of questions and principles
that prompt you to inspect and adapt your own Agile Governance
frame of reference to suit the needs of your business and the needs of
your customers. We want you questioning, examining, probing,
experimenting, and reflecting in a way that makes the stanchions your
own... and most importantly of all, continuously evolving. It would be
thrilling to see readers with their own, bespoke adaptations of the five
stanchions that suit their own forms of governance and the needs of
their customers.
   When we discuss variability, we like to paraphrase Dave Snowden.
He once said that you should never have perfect transparency because
it eliminates variability. It becomes a “solved game”, to borrow a
phrase from our friends in the competitive Checkers and Go
communities2. A little bit of opacity forces people to think outside the
box and create new solutions. In other words, variability is where
your competitive advantage lies. In fact, over-application of strict
methods and processes in a creative domain will limit your ability to
exploit variability for your benefit. When we think about designing
patterns and ways of working, they need to vary by domain for this
very reason. Different problems have different solutions.
   You need to harness this power. The stanchions—or whichever
model you choose to help build effective Governance—provide
anchors to align around. You, as an individual and an organization,
need to find the points of variability—the skills, knowledge, and
approaches that make your work singular and powerful—and use
them to carve out a space in the modern economy.
   This discussion of variability and adaptation raises an important
question: how far can you move away from the stanchions before they
stop functioning as intended?
   Excellent question. There are degrees of freedom in how you
interpret and apply the learnings behind the five stanchions, and they
were designed to be flexible for both adaptation and learning. The
initial concepts behind the stanchions function well as anchors;
however, as soon as you step outside the book and begin applying
this knowledge to your own organization, you’re going to discover a
lot of places where our learnings and yours won’t fit together
perfectly.
   That’s because, while the five stanchions of Agile Governance are a
frame of reference to help support your own governance, they’re
more in the style of Clayton Christensen3. That is, a framework
without a framework.
   What does that mean?
   Consider martial arts. When you learn martial arts, one of the first
and most important lessons to internalize is that the volume of what
you know is less important than the quality. A thousand poorly
executed techniques will not serve you as well as one or two executed
with speed, accuracy, and control. To understand how to perform a
technique with quality, you need to steep yourself in the foundations
of that martial art: the footwork, patterns, weight transfer, body
control, and so on.
   The more you learn about those fundamentals, the more you
realize how much there is to learn. We know this through our own
experiences as martial artists. Earning a black belt in karate wasn’t an
endpoint, it was a moment when we reflected and realized we’d only
just gotten a grip on the basics. Now, the real learning could begin.
Sensei Lucky Pandelidis from the Winged Dragon Go Ju Ryu dojo,
who we were fortunate enough to train with, always says he can’t wait
for people to qualify for Shodan-ho4, the first black belt. Only then
can he start to actually teach them karate.
   We’ve also seen what happens when people move away from those
fundamentals. Oftentimes, it’s not good. That’s how you get flashy
techniques with no practical application. When you see people in the
ring sparring without those fundamentals, you notice gaps in their
patterns. They lack sustainability and, ironically, the flexibility
provided by drilling the fundamentals. Interestingly, these people can
be dangerous because they’re unpredictable and lack control. In the
ring so as in business: take extra caution when encountering someone
with the power to make an impact and no idea how to wield it.
   It’s the same in governance. Every governance structure will be
unique, but if you abandon the foundations then you’ll end up back
where you started: flashy technique piled atop flashy technique until
you end up with a massive organizational construct teetering under
its own weight. Humans tend to overcomplicate, which leads us to
reflect on Gall’s Law. “A complex system that works is invariably found to
have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from
scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to
start over with a working simple system.”5
   Many organizations that we work with today and consider
progressive, sustainable, and keeping ahead of their competition,
have taken the view that ongoing transformation is critical to their
success. Transformation is becoming a capability rather than a state in
and of itself. In one organization we are actively trying to discourage
the use of the word transformation because of the implications that
there is an end state—to be transformed—which will then lead to
inertia later on. We are trying to nudge the static culture of that
organization closer to a place of constant evolution of their practices
and processes. In another organization, we’ve done a lot of work to
reclaim and recontextualize the word transformation, so that it is
something known within that organization’s culture as an ongoing
activity. The reasons are simple. If you are not changing, adapting,
and moving forward compared to the pace of change and complexity
around you, you are essentially going backwards. Your competition is
not standing still. And neither are the people who want to be your
competitor.
   It takes a certain organizational mindset to slow down and work on
mastering the basics before moving on to unique implementations. A
rare mindset, you might say. We’ve seen a lot of instances where an
organization detects a problem and then creates a new process or
control to manage it. Problem solved, right? Time to move on.
   The problem here is that nobody is slowing down to assess
whether that control or process aligns with the framework. They’re
not asking, “what did we learn while solving this problem?” The urge
is always to move onward as fast as possible instead of returning to
the basics, comparing with the new ways, and growing as a result.
   So, how can you begin a process of continuous evolution that
actively moves your governance forward without falling into the trap
of creating unnecessary controls? How, as you move forward with
applying the five stanchions to your own governance, can you stay
aware of what your organization needs and be ready to continually
inspect and adapt your own Agile Governance?
   You can’t start from a static position. You have to get out there and
start by wading into the weeds. Begin by moving towards the new and
experimental practices we’ve discussed in the stanchions… and those
in the coming chapters. You can’t wait for solutions to present
themselves. The only way to succeed is to uncover them yourselves.
   That said, we do have a few recommended techniques for you to
explore as a foundation for building great Agile Governance.

2 Checkers, AKA Draughts, has been “weak-solved”, meaning that players
who know how to play perfectly can always at least force a draw. Go, on the
other hand, is a much larger game. It has been weak-solved if played on a
miniature board (7x7 squares), but there are more potential moves on a
19x19 Go board than there are atoms in the universe, so that solve might be
a little way off. For more information, check
