## Chapter 4: The Changing Face of Organizations

Environments shape organizations, and organizations in turn shape their
environments by their actions and reactions. Change is one of the only
constants, and only seems to ever accelerate (especially in VUCA times). In
these situations, before making major changes, it’s vital to identify why the
change is happening, where the pressure is coming from, and what the
ultimate outcome of the change should be. So be purposively considerate of
the emerging challenge or opportunity to shape a customer need.
    We don’t stop often enough to ask ourselves critical questions, like: Why is
the change happening? What signals are we receiving (and based upon what
data?) that something new is happening that requires a response? It’s important
to clarify that VUCA comes wearing many faces and is often hard to recognize.
Our first instinct when things get chaotic, volatile, uncertain, or ambiguous is
to look outside our own organization, to world markets, international politics
and economics, or shifting customer needs. Why not? Nobody likes admitting
that their own house is in disarray. This is why, even in this age of abundant
data and information, many organizations still don’t turn the mirror on
themselves and observe with a critical eye. However, the truth is that VUCA is
both extrinsic and intrinsic.
    Given that our organizations are reflections of the world outside our doors
(or Zoom screens), it’s safe to say that the greater the VUCA outside, the faster
VUCA will grow on the inside. When nobody understands what the market
wants or why existing products aren’t meeting customer needs, uncertainty will
grow inside teams. We resort to trying to guess the customer’s need, which is
often to our detriment. Communications may become chaotic. Top-down
leadership may calm moods, but in many cases, it only increases volatility, and
so on and so on.
    We’ve seen this play out many times before, and the results are disastrous.
For example, let’s look at Blockbuster and Kodak: two major organizations
brought down not through a single poor decision but through a combination
of internal and external VUCA, and a reluctance to understand or adapt to the
market. Blockbuster Video is often cited as having collapsed after turning
down an offer to buy a budding Netflix. This is, of course, only part of the
story. Netflix wasn’t a sure bet at the time, and Blockbuster launched a rival
service called Total Access in 2007 that boosted subscriber numbers while
Netflix was busy losing its customer base. However, Blockbuster still didn’t
understand what customers really wanted. Punitive and predatory late fees,
coupled with internal VUCA and the ousting of a customer-centric CEO in
favor of a team focused on squeezing profits by increasing the cost of Total
Access, meant Blockbuster was left in the dust.
    Likewise with Kodak, who are often held up as the purest example of a
company failing to adapt to new market conditions. In fact, we remember
some meetings out at the Kodak Factory in Preston, Melbourne, while they
still had it, talking about how to better adapt to digital change. Some believe
that Kodak refused to pivot from film cameras to digital. As always, the truth is
more complicated.
    On paper, Kodak did everything right. Their teams developed the world’s
first digital camera and invested billions in prototyping consumer-friendly
versions. They even purchased Ofoto, a photo sharing website, ten years prior
to the launch of Instagram. However, each of these moves came a little too late,
and instead of listening to the customer and embracing online photo sharing,
Kodak used Ofoto to promote their core business: expensive photo printing.
All these factors combined saw Kodak stumble during a period of VUCA and
fail to transition into the next normal. The power of the incumbent business
model, and its sway over an organization’s systems, processes, and therefore
control mechanisms, is strong1.
    As such, organizational change is often a response to both internal and
external factors. The result is that the amount of demand for change exceeds
(by a wide margin) our capacity to execute it. It’s not uncommon for a
company to have, at any one time, multiple strategies in play to help them
transition from one type of organization to another. They may even have
several strategies running in tandem across different areas of the business,
which leads to internal competition. The problem we’ve seen is that these
strategies have only tenuous links to an overall organizational ambition, and
don’t align at all as part of any grand plan, and lead to competing KPIs where
the organization is trying to retain its current business and reward it, whilst
building the new. This leads to huge and growing backlogs of change as
organizations struggle to identify, prioritize, and execute these plans. Worse
still, by the time the solution has been rolled out, the problem has
metamorphosed entirely.
    When the required speed of change (an extrinsic factor) exceeds the internal
capacity to change, intrinsic VUCA increases once again. This makes VUCA
an exponential, accelerating force: when a company is in disarray because
they’re pouring all their change resources into catching up to outdated market
trends, customers will feel their expectations aren’t being met, leading to
further customer divestment, leading to more VUCA. This is the perennial
self-fulfilling prophecy.
    To combat this, many organizations will enter what they call a
transformational state, where they profess to engage in a
reinvention/transformation. What we see instead, is that they’re more often
becoming transitional: helping a small number of teams or departments
become more agile in order to meet a specific need without the frameworks
required to support long-term, whole of organization agile thinking and
governance. The result is a bottleneck where a semi-effective team using agile
ways of working is unable to force their products through the roadblocks
thrown up by larger, more traditional systems. We see this as organizational
antibodies emerging to crush a virus—without realizing, of course, that the
virus they’re destroying is the first step in a necessary evolution.
    It’s also common to see organizations do something akin to performative
agile: moving people between teams, changing titles, relabeling roles, etc, but
without taking any of the necessary steps to change the underlying system or
structure. Even performative agile can have positive effects, and it’s great to see
organizations showing ambition when it comes to making positive change.
Over time though, the system usually reasserts itself and the labels fall off.
    Nothing changes, and VUCA stays unaddressed.
    Some blame internal culture for this. You’re probably familiar with the
phrase, “culture eats strategy for breakfast”.2 It might be more accurate to say
the Operating Model eats strategy for breakfast. It’s rarely culture holding back
change, but the fundamental ways in which the organization is built to operate
and solve the known and current customer problem. Not the new and
emergent customer opportunity.
    In the market, specifically around agile transformations, you may have been
witness to or read about organizations making large-scale change journeys.
Retaining an existing structure is often the reason why localized moves to
Tribes, Agile Release Trains or Value Streams aren’t having the intended effects.
Along with the principle or philosophy that designing a new Operating Model
and expecting to retain your existing structure will bring success.
    Ambition is easy. Breaking the established philosophies, principles, and
culturally ingrained ways of working is hard. You can do it incrementally and
piecemeal and we call this fractal branching; when change begins with a core
pillar and then branches out over time into smaller and smaller changes.
However, we often don’t set the correct core pillars. We begin with simple agile
concepts like Product Owners and Scrum instead of examining structure and
Operating Model.
    Thankfully, we’re seeing the tide begin to turn. Failed transformations are
common enough. The latest statistic we saw was that around 70% of
transformations fail3 to meet their core outcomes. The importance of
beginning with structural change is becoming inescapable. We’ve also learned
about the many intrinsic layers change needs to ensure success, and how
important it is to synchronize them if we want to achieve any level of lasting
outcomes.
    So, if change is constant and VUCA is ever-present, why are we seeing so
much organizational change happening in such a short space of time? You can
probably guess.
COVID-19 and the Move to Remote
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the most recent, largest, and most
obvious factor in the acceleration of organizational change. It’s the primary
cause of global VUCA, the growth in digitality, and the ubiquity of remote
working. Want to run a business in these trying times? Change, or collapse.
    We have changed! There isn’t an organization on earth that hasn’t adapted
itself to fit the new shape of the past three years, and the largest (and most
enduring) of all those changes is the move to remote working.
    Remote work isn’t a new concept. In fact, the phrase “telecommuting” was
coined by Jack Nilles in his 1976 book, The Telecommunications-transportation
tradeoff: options for tomorrow4. IBM was already experimenting with what they
called “work from home” in that period, with 2,000 employees working from
home by 1983. To be fair, IBM had easier access to home PCs and terminal
emulators at that time than the average Joe. However, the concept had been
proven, and by 2006 over four million Americans were working from home.
    As a result, much of the infrastructure that saved our collective bacon in
2020 was already in place. Zoom was already eight years old, and workers had
been cursing Microsoft Teams since 2017. Webcams and fiber-to-the-home
were standard, and you’d be hard-pressed to find an employee in 2019 who
didn’t have a passing familiarity with remote work/coworking methods and
standards.
    Even so, the events of early 2020 forced us to go remote, fast, and on a scale
never previously considered. We did it! We collaborated, broke established
norms, made the brittle parts of our companies more flexible, and performed
the largest (and fastest) collective shift in ways of working the world has ever
seen. It was like the world of knowledge work, across every country across the
globe, had acted as an almost single consciousness and achieved change
virtually overnight. Even Microsoft Teams has evolved for the better.
    We also witnessed a mass “radical repurposing”—a drive for organizations
to take existing tools, strategies, concepts, methods or frameworks and adapt
them for use in an entirely new domain. David Snowden may dub this type of
event an exaptive moment5, when stresses in the environment force a radical
change in how systems are used, creating new mental pathways, and offering
new possibilities. This defines remote work: as a whole, workforces operating
out of the home was not a new concept in 2020. It was the sudden necessity
for remote work that forced many organizations to take existing tools and
methodologies and stitch them together into functioning systems. Yes, much
of the infrastructure required for the remote working revolution already
existed. The rest was cobbled-together, duct-taped, jerry-rigged, until we got it
working the way we needed it to. These experiments resulted in all-new
technologies that integrate those older technologies and processes into single,
streamlined systems of work.
    The shift to remote work was smoother for some organizations than others.
It quickly became apparent throughout 2020 that the key when moving to
remote work is that the right tooling and processes be instituted from the very
beginning, in order to give everyone a solid connection to the strategy. The
visibility provided by work traceability systems (which make the connection
between work streams, initiatives, work items, etc.) allow everyone to see the
threads between the work on their desk and the broader strategy and goals in
play. These tools make the system visible and tangible.
    In addition to this, executives need to know exactly what they want before
they ask for it. Because whatever they ask for, they’re going to get. And once
they start getting it, it won’t be simple to have their teams change direction.
Momentum is difficult to alter on the fly, so ensuring the strategy is both
correct and well communicated is vital. Reprioritization has a cost.
    This is doubly important when discussing internal strategies, which
sometimes conflict. A larger strategy, once propagated down through federated
departments, teams and silos, can take on new and strange forms which create
friction, if not outright competition. Friction6 is a well-known concept in the
military sphere—Carl von Clausewitz coined the term to describe the many
small, surprising things that happen in wartime that upset perfect plans and
make executing even the simplest strategy difficult. Stephen Bungay observed
the same thing occurring in business environments, where human beings with
independent wills were all trying to achieve a collective purpose in a fast-
changing, complex, unpredictable environment7. Friction is a natural
occurrence when every layer of the organization is articulating a broader
strategy in a different way. Not to mention that the further down you go, the
more difficult it becomes to clearly link these strategies back to the original,
global vision. Remote work, and the increase in communication distance,
exacerbates this.
    Those organizations that knew what they wanted, that did get the right
tools and processes into the right hands, and did maintain visibility, had a
much better chance of surviving the remote-work transition. They’ve also
provided us with new insights over the past years into the effects of remote
work on their people, processes, and technology. Professor Nick Bloom8 at
Stanford has done the hard work of collecting and crunching the data. His
conclusion: work from home has begun to stabilize across many industries at
an average of around three days per week. Organizations that can’t match that
will experience a flight risk and lose experienced employees to more flexible
companies. Who can argue with an average of 770 fewer hours spent
commuting every year? Organizations believing that remote work equals lost
productivity are misinformed: many employees spend the time regained from
the morning commute either preparing for or actively working, meaning that
most organizations have experienced steady or improved productivity. Those
who have seen clear losses in productivity have more fundamental problems to
solve than where or when the work gets done.
    In fact, in one organization that performed productivity assessments during
2020, post the core move to work from home, found that developer metrics
had improved by 20-25% as a result of remote working. Workers were
becoming more efficient without leaders needing to look over their shoulders,
which led to a corresponding improvement in trust and work/life balance. This
raises the question: would leaders have trusted their teams enough to institute
a change like this if the pandemic hadn’t made it necessary? How many other
positive changes have we missed out on because we haven’t been forced to take
a crisis-inspired leap-of-faith?
    Secondary impacts of the shift to remote work are harder to sort into
baskets of good versus bad. Here in Australia, where we live, inner-city
property prices (especially commercial property) are cooling or even falling,
contrasted by a boom in suburban or regional property. Renewed interest in
Australia’s satellite cities is generally good for everyone, but few are happy that
the formerly bustling centers of Melbourne, Sydney, and Canberra have been
hollowed out by the move to remote work. Across the world, this has become
evident, with London, Dallas, New York, San Francisco, and Boston for
example, experiencing the same effects as shown in the McKinsey study,
“Empty Spaces and Hybrid Places”9.
    So, good news! We now know that, when faced with an immovable object
(like a global pandemic), we can upend so-called fixed structures and find a
way to thrive in uncertain times. The majority of the knowledge-work industry
—hundreds of millions of people—managed to transform overnight. A crisis
emerged, and the industry responded. So, why do so many organizations
continue to make flimsy excuses when faced with further change? “It’s too
complicated! We don’t have the resources! Our culture can’t sustain it!” How
can we build and strengthen that response mechanism when there isn’t a crisis
forcing our hand?
    Let’s explore this question using a recent client of ours, a
telecommunications provider. We were assisting with a large-scale ways-of-
working transformation and our first exercises were to help everyone better
understand impediments to change, and how they could deal with change now
and in the future, so as to better set the stage for the upcoming transformation.
The response was universal: In a crisis, we’re good! Why? Because our ways of
working change to suit the situation. We have a different style of leadership: direct
and controlling. We make immediate decisions and have a clear goal, which is to
get ourselves out of chaos.
    In short, a crisis is well-defined, and many organizations have protocols in
place that dictate how they respond to a crisis. Everyone knows their role, so
the response is a whole-organization effort. However, the effectiveness of this
organization’s response to a crisis sheds light on why other organizations
struggle to respond when they aren’t in crisis mode. A lack of strong, direct
leadership, a lack of protocols, and a fog surrounding who should be
responding to what (and why their response matters, or how their work is
related to the strategy). The decomposition of information and strategy simply
isn’t present.
    This observation broadly holds true across many global industries:
organizational governance hasn’t changed to match the shift in ways of
working, nor done enough work to evolve its processes, trust mechanisms, or
speed of digitalization. In fact, even those organizations that loosened their
governance mechanisms to enable more efficient remote work are now back to
pulling on the reins. They’re happy to keep the increases in productivity;
however, they still want to address every small misstep with controls piled atop
controls piled atop more controls.
    We’ve seen this first-hand in our work with a Global Organization, where
advice given during a portfolio review was, “We have a few projects that are at
risk, but we still feel we’re on track to complete all the planned initiatives
before the end of the year.” Only two weeks later, it became clear that few of
those initiatives would hit their targets. In the space of a fortnight, we’d gone
from a systems-view where everything was good and green, to an all-hands-to-
battle-stations situation where everything was red.
    How could everything have gone wrong so quickly?
    The truth is, nothing had changed in those two weeks. The problem was
that layers of governance had become so opaque that nobody in the portfolio
review group had true visibility into what was happening at the ground level.
Roles and responsibilities had become so diffuse that nobody knew what they
were responsible for, and nobody owned or truly invested themselves in their
projects. In short, so much governance had been added over the preceding
twelve months that nobody really understood who owned or controlled
projects.
    Finding out why these projects had gone from green to red in such a short
space of time was only half the challenge. The other half was fixing the
problem. The traditional answer would be to identify gaps and add controls
like weekly status checks to ensure this situation couldn’t repeat. We disagreed
—the answer was to take bad governance away and remove controls, thus
forcing people to take greater responsibility, plug information gaps of their
own volition, and approach problems from a more agile mindset.
    This returns us to our original proposition: Agile Governance isn’t about
squeezing more governance into your agility. We want to put more agility into
your existing governance. Sometimes, that means reframing certain processes
and mindsets. Other times, it means removing those processes entirely.
The New Normal VS the Next Normal
When discussing the move to remote work and all it entails, people love
invoking the “new normal,” implying a clean delineation between one state of
working and another. Others will point to the “next normal,” implying a
constant, never-ending stream of changes without pause for breath.
    Reality, as always, lies somewhere in the middle. Change is a constant yet
some aspects of how we live and work have already stabilized post-lockdown,
and will remain stable for some time to come. For example, the fact that a
large proportion of the workforce have adjusted to remote work and are
unlikely to give it up entirely. On the other hand, changes in governance
required to enable and sustain these new models will be ongoing for the
foreseeable future. Inside and surrounding every “new normal” are a series of
“next normals”, and these interlocking changes have created a shift in what we
mean by the word “transformation”.
    Transformation should not be viewed as an event, but a capability. The
accelerating occurrence of VUCA events means that strategy needs to change
increasingly often in response to exaptive events, and structure needs to be
flexible enough to accommodate and deliver upon that change. In many ways,
the pandemic has functioned not just as a test of how well organizations
responded to a switch to remote work, but also as a test of their capabilities to
continually transform throughout successive waves of economic, technological,
and social upheaval. Those who were able to adjust to the new normal survived
for a while… However, only the organizations who were able to adjust to the
new realities of 2020 while staying on their toes and preparing for the next
wave of change, and the next, and the next, were able to thrive.
    The question now is: as Covid-19 becomes increasingly viewed by the
public as a common, endemic illness (whether for good or ill), and the world
transitions into a permanent state of hybrid remote work, will organizations
retain and feed the transformational capabilities they’ve built since 2020? Will
they grab hold of their achievements and look for ways to scale them? Or will
they let that skill evaporate and, once again, see their systems of work decay
and deprecate over time? Will they then outsource the problem to their
consultancies when the next crisis hits?
    For some organizations, that depends on whether they feel we’re sitting in a
semi-stable “new normal” or whether we have one foot in and one foot out of
the “next normal”. The difference often depends on whether those
organizations feel they can predict the next great VUCA event, the next game-
changer for our industries. Is it possible? Ask ten futurists and you’ll likely get
ten dissenting opinions. It’s fair to say that future pandemics (either fresh
variants of COVID-19 or something altogether new), the roll-on effects of
international conflict (which always cause ripples beyond our ability to
forecast), and the normalization of AI via deep-learning, Generative Pre-
trained Transformer (GPT) models, will all feature in future conversations
about the next-normal. It’s likely that the speed of change will continue to
increase. Customer needs and demands will be increasingly complex.
Adaptivity will no longer be a capability to develop only in the event of
change.
    All evidence suggests that the challenges faced by traditionally governed
organizations will only grow over the coming years. Our processes always begin
at the same point: an analysis of the current obstacle under the assumption
that we already broadly know both the problem and the solution. In a VUCA
world, you don’t really know the problem. To quote Donald Rumsfeld, Former
United States Secretary of Defense, VUCA problems are “the Unknown
Unknowns”10, and the solution is orders of magnitude more complex than
whatever you have pre-prepared in your toolbox. Big governance is fantastic at
operating in an environment with known problems, constraints, and processes.
It collapses as soon as you enter the fog of complexity and uncertainty, and you
need to move forward with imperfect information.
    Many people believe “doing agile” will prepare them for the next normal, as
if agile is a verb, a set of exercises to accomplish along the road to success. Let’s
dump that notion right now. Agile is not a verb. Agile is a collection of
philosophies, mindsets, and imperatives that help us navigate through the gray
of VUCA. Agile is not a single process, but agility is an outcome. An
organization that has inherent agility is able to quickly and efficiently deploy
the various tools and processes that make up what many people think of as
agile. It is, however, just as important to have the agility in hand to take those
processes away, reinvent them, or create something altogether new. Aiming for
Minimum Viable Everything is still the done thing, as our friends from TQM
and the Lean movement will often remind us—as we so often find, what’s new
is sometimes just something that’s been rediscovered. None of that is possible if
the underlying governance isn’t in place to allow for that agility.
    Hence the need for a remote ready Agile Governance frame of reference,
that is both suited for our current “new normal” while remaining ready for the
next. Agile Governance is built upon four key concepts: Sensible Transparency,
Conductive Leadership, Patterns of Work, and Data-Driven Reasoning. It
enables the power of autonomous teams to achieve high performance, if they
operate in a remote setting without the need for colocation. The purpose of
these four stanchions is to build a culture of distributed governance
throughout the organization, which in turn distributes a sense of responsibility
and ownership.
    Alongside these four stanchions is a fifth, equally crucial stanchion:
Humanity, the cornerstone. People are not resources, and they are not
interchangeable bodies on a factory floor. All agilists know the human element.
In fact, agile was founded on re-embedding humans into technology work.
However, we’ve observed that this element needs to be re-found and
established in concrete as a part of Agile Governance.
    These five stanchions are not new to the world of agile ways of working.
Sensible Transparency has always been considered key to enabling the flow of
work, and conductive leadership rather than top-down leadership is a tried-
and-tested component in helping people contribute fully and enthusiastically.
Patterns of Work is a complex topic, however, and refers largely to how we
proscribe the work. Finally, data is crucial for Data-Driven Reasoning when
the work is happening in the office, remotely, or the hybrid in between. All of
these combine to enable greater layers of integrity and trust, which allows us to
apply agile values and principles to Agile Governance in the human context.
    Sharing the strategic intent allows people the flexibility to decide where,
how, when, and what they need to do to achieve the common objective. This is
definitely not a new observation and can be found in many worthy tomes such
as Team of Teams11, the Art of Action12, and so forth.
    Given that hybrid and remote work environments are here to stay, at least
for the foreseeable future, it’s our belief that a shift to Agile Governance is non-
optional. The benefits are indisputable: reduced traffic, greener outcomes,
improved productivity, cost savings from an organizational and individual
perspective, etc. Most people are enjoying better work-life balances, and that
reflects on the quality of their work, and overall job satisfaction.
    In an April 2020 survey, Gartner found that three-quarters of CFOs
planned to increase the number of employees working remotely on a
permanent basis. Suresh Kumar, Walmart Global CTO, stated: “We believe the
way of working in the future, particularly in tech, will be fundamentally
different than it was before. We believe it will be one in which working
virtually will be the new normal, at least for most of the work we lead.”
    If you want to maximize the outcomes of your remote and hybrid work,
you need to think of the entire organization through the lens of Agile
Governance. To do this, we need to put people back at the heart of governance
and put humanity at the heart of our technology.
    For that, you need to understand the five stanchions of Agile Governance.
