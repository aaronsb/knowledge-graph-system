## Chapter 3: What is Governance?

Before we can dive into how to inject agile into governance, we need to take
the time to describe, at a much deeper level, what we believe governance is. For
our purposes, we are more focused on corporate governance, the way that
organizations need to be governed, rather than broader theories of governance
itself. There is no single conclusive definition of corporate governance, but if
you take a global view, there are common overarching themes that we will
focus on for discussing Agile Governance.
   In the United States1 for example: The corporate governance system is best
understood as the set of fiduciary and managerial responsibilities that binds a
company’s management, shareholders, and the board within a larger, societal
context defined by legal, regulatory, competitive, economic, democratic, ethical, and
other societal forces.
    The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)2
defines governance in these terms: Corporate governance involves a set of
relationships between a company’s management, its board, its shareholders, and
other stakeholders. Corporate governance also provides the structure through which
the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives
and monitoring performance are determined.
   The Governance Institute of Australia3, for example, defines it in these
terms: Governance encompasses the system by which an organization is controlled,
and operates and the mechanisms by which it and its people are held to account.
Ethics, risk management, compliance, and administration are all elements of
governance.
   The ASX Corporate Governance Council goes a little further: The phrase
“corporate governance” describes “the framework of rules, relationships, systems and
processes within and by which authority is exercised and controlled within
corporations. It encompasses the mechanisms by which companies, and those in
control, are held to account.”4 (In fact, this definition was drawn from Justice
Owen in the HIH Royal Commission, The Failure of HIH Insurance Volume 1:
A Corporate Collapse and Its Lessons, Commonwealth of Australia, April 2003, at
page xxxiv.) Good corporate governance promotes investor confidence, which is
crucial to the ability of entities listed on the ASX to compete for capital.
Okay, but What Does That Mean?
Let’s boil this down to the essentials by thinking about governance and how it
applies to the ways in which we work. Governance is, at its root, about how we
intend to govern our systems, what we use to control those systems, and how
we can provide assurances those controls are actually working as many large-
scale organizations are not run by the people that own them, creating a need
for broader controls. As for systems, we are largely referring to the social and
organizational systems that people create when they come together around
things, as opposed to the more common usage of systems regarding
technological systems. Within this context, Governance also includes
monitoring and controlling the execution of strategy with the whole system of
work in mind. Strategy left ungoverned becomes words on a page, and the
work executed becomes unaligned to the strategy. Then we see drift and waste
emerge across the organization—we do work that’s not valued and not effective
and doesn’t get us to our goal.
    You are likely already familiar with traditional governance, which relies on
extensive planning and heavyweight control mechanisms in order to keep
systems running as intended. Agile Governance has the same root definition
and all the same foundations as traditional governance: to consider how
processes, interactions, and controls enable outcomes, but seeks to do this in a
more flexible, adaptable, and agile manner. It’s not just about project
management offices and processes; it’s about reimagining how you govern your
entire system of work at all levels to enable your organization’s success.
    Like traditional governance, Agile Governance values planning yet is
flexible and adaptive, enabling the ability to change the plan to suit the
situation as more information emerges. As such, it is better suited to support
responding to change when prior plans lose relevance in the face of VUCA. We
see that the fundamental difference between traditional and Agile Governance
is that traditional governance models assume that the future can be predictably
determined and that we need to govern the execution of plans to take us
towards that future, whereas Agile Governance assumes that the future is
uncertain and that we need to govern the decisions, actions, behaviors, etc.
that will allow us to find the best path forward.
    You may have already heard of Agile Governance, which is described as
oversight and decision-making of spending, audit, and compliance, or perhaps
forecasting expenses and measurement. There are also a number of models
touted by consultancies and scaling frameworks as plug-and-play panaceas to
solve your governance woes. These models can be useful, but they generally err
towards processes, tools, and documentation rather than exploring the whole
of the model and how we control the situation. In the words of George Box,
“Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.” While this quote was
related to statistical models, the analogy still applies. Regardless, we would
struggle to label those sorts of models as governing with agility.
    To better understand what we think of as Agile Governance, let’s revisit
those original definitions. We see that governance is a stated outcome of the
process of interactions through laws, norms, power, and language. Meanwhile,
one of the key values of the Agile Manifesto is: “Individuals and interactions
over processes and tools.” So, governance and agility aren’t in opposition. By
definition, they support one another, so long as we ensure that interactions are
taking precedence over processes. As shown in each of the four values of the
Agile Manifesto, we do mean “over” and not “in place of ”.
    The idea of a larger societal context could refer to a community, a family, an
organization, or anything in between. However, the word organized, in
particular, implies a structure, a system of control. Some agilists might recoil at
the mention of controls—they shouldn’t! Control isn’t a dirty word. However,
we all probably have some experience with bad controls (like weekly audits and
reports) put in place by leadership as a reflexive reaction to their distance from
the work being done. We could argue that these leaders don’t actually want to
control their direct reports. What they want is an assurance that everything is
functioning as intended, and the customer is being served.
    This may be, in part, due to an element of trust or, more accurately,
distrust. Many people struggle to trust what they’ve been told, thanks to bad
experiences. Other times, distrust forms the basis of their overarching mental
model and bias. Many companies exhibit low-trust cultures, and you will often
find higher degrees of process and centralized control in these archetypes. The
answer is not to trash the concept of control, but to reconsider what controls
need to be put in place for what problem, what context, audience, and so on.
    Let’s also examine who is doing this governance: the government of a state,
a market, or a network. One of the values of the Agile Manifesto is “customer
collaboration over contract negotiation”. When we collaborate with customers,
we create mutually supportive networks. Therefore, it is fundamentally agile to
build a system of governance driven by our relationships with our customers.
    Some may take exception to us reinterpreting the Agile Manifesto in this
way in order to serve our concept of Agile Governance. We would argue that
the Manifesto is twenty years old, as of our writing, and must be subject to
interpretation and adaptation. Otherwise, how can it be agile? In fact, Dr.
Alistair Cockburn, a prime initiator of the agile movement, considers the
Manifesto an artifact of that period in time, which must be added to in order
to remain relevant for changing contexts. It was relevant for the domain at the
time and the problems the cosigners were facing, but now?
    This mirrors the events of the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325. Emperor
Constantine herded 300 arguing bishops into a single location to resolve their
differences and align on a single, unified Christian doctrine5. That same
doctrine still forms the foundation of the Orthodox and Catholic churches, yet
many denominations build upon this doctrine in a way that suits their
community and needs. So, too, must we add what we need to the Manifesto in
order to keep pace with the world of today. If you need evidence that the
founding signatories of the Agile Manifesto believe this too, then check their
actual page with the values and principles. https://agilemanifesto.org/. It has
remained unchanged since Ward Cunningham posted it on the web in 2001!
Except for adding language translations and signatories, the latter also stopped
because the number of signatories became too hard to track. We do note that
we got in early and were listed in time. Many, however, have not only built
doctrines on top of it; they have created industries around it.
    The final part of the intent—the simplification of governance to political
processes within and between institutions—is a little trickier. It’s an accurate
definition, yet one that we wish wasn’t necessarily true. Governance creates,
amplifies, and thrives upon politics within and around organizations. Politics
creates power and authority, and in many organizations, we mistakenly invest
power into governance, thus taking it away from the teams doing the actual
work. How often do we treat processes driven by governance and controls as
dogma?
    Many years ago, while attending an agile training course with Dr. Alistair
Cockburn, we ran an exercise around developing a walking skeleton backlog.
We broke into small groups to tackle a problem with a very ambiguous
direction. Within the space of a minute, there were already arguments arising
about sticking to specific processes, even when a process hadn’t been defined!
We went from idea to solution to process to dogma in the blink of an eye.
Humans seem to be hardwired to look for a pathway to follow and ease the
burden of thinking. Dr. Cockburn himself summed it up for us that day:
“Process is just someone else’s good trick.”
    Human nature tends to try to conserve energy by simplifying pathways.
Where change is hard and can often be painful, we see that scenario emerge
time and again where process becomes the arbiter of progress. Given
governance traditionally tends to encourage fixed process, policy, and
constraints, it clearly speaks to some innermost needs and perhaps even the
essence of humanity to make life easier the next time around.
    The relationship between politics and governance is a function of how
humans rely upon norms, structures, and behaviors to create a sense of control
and stability (both within organizations and otherwise). However, the pursuit
of control and stability can go too far. How many of us have seen an
organization that defines itself so concretely that they can’t imagine stepping
outside the walls of their domain? Or in which they’ve lost the sense of
connection between their services/product functions and the solutions their
customers are asking for? Mission statements like, “We do X or We are Y” can
help an organization ground itself. But when those statements become
enforced through rigid governance, things can get hairy.
    We see this problem manifesting in how many large organizations now
embark on customer revolutions, customer centricity transformation, or
anything to do with remembering or reconnecting to its reason for existence,
i.e. the customer. Governance is often a symbol or a symptom of this. When
we see this, we often revisit Peter Drucker’s thoughts on organizations: “The
purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer.” Ironically, it’s not the
front-line staff forgetting this. Employees in brick and mortar or service
industries stay close to the customer and know how to serve them. It’s the
people in the back offices, or organizations with digital-only functions, who
often don’t know who their customers are or what they need.
   Let’s jump back to that definition one final time. Governance is a construct
of the decision-making and decision-making delegation among the actors
involved in a collective problem. In other words, governance should be formed
by the people actively solving problems and getting involved in decision-
making. So why do we so often see governance dictated by people outside or
above those circles? What could we achieve if we put governance back in the
hands of the people getting the work done? We would argue that successful
governance should be distributed and take authority to the work without
sacrificing control levers. Good governance, agile or otherwise, demands a
sense of responsibility and ownership from everyone, which allows for greater
levels of trust and, in turn, higher performing teams. What we tend to see
though, is the continued manifestation of Taylorist thinking transferring the
manufacturing context to knowledge work: separation of workers from
management. With this mindset, it makes sense to keep governance as a
separate activity. However, much of the knowledge workplace is not a factory
anymore.
Who Does Governance Serve?
That’s a tricky question. It’s better to break it down into two parts: who does
governance serve now, and who should governance serve if done correctly?
   In the context of this book, governance serves several stakeholders. In
traditional settings, that makes the primary beneficiaries of governance and the
people demanding it the shareholders of the company and the broader
community, which expects the upholding of cultural standards. We often
include employees in this, given the impact on people of organizational
decisions. That’s why we have HR policies. The formal leadership group of the
organization responds to this expectation by setting strategy, determining
direction, bearing responsibility for problems, and reaping the rewards of
success. They’re the people who, in the case of publicly listed organizations,
have to report to shareholders on matters of investment, capital, trends,
margins, returns on investment, and so on. They’re also the ones who have to
comply with government and industry regulations.
   A large part of creating successful Agile Governance requires us to rethink
the role leadership plays in governing the work, and the system. Traditional
hierarchical management theory X-style leadership6 doesn’t like to distribute
authority out of fear of eroding their power base. In other words, we can’t
create Agile Governance or serve those closest to the work using classical
methods. Yet the move to Holacracy7 and totally distributed governance with
no traditional hierarchy doesn’t seem to succeed either.
   If we want to create modern governance, we must begin with modern
leadership principles.
Why Do We Need and Ask for Governance?
In traditional organizations, governance may, to those who suffer the worst of
its excesses, be the boogeyman. A system of constraints and audit processes
that restrict creativity, autonomy, and service of the customer.
    It’s critical that you don’t get that impression from what we’ve explored so
far in this chapter. We need governance. We beg for governance. However, we
want good governance. We want governance that enables autonomy with
directional alignment; that empowers interconnected networks of people and
teams who all have the ability to respond to emerging changes and needs. We
want governance that empowers and uplifts. We want governance that creates
opportunity.
    The problem is that governance is often structured around a few critical
concerns: ensuring that the organization is meeting its obligations (to
shareholders, partners, governments, etc.) and can continue to trade. This
results in a lot of governance being directed by external third parties, who
mandate regular audits to ensure that the organization is actually doing what it
says it’s doing. This type of governance focuses on ensuring accurate
information can flow to other stakeholders, and that this information can be
relied upon when making decisions. This large-scale, outside-in governance is
then distributed and filters down through the organization in the form of
cultures, behaviors, and processes.
    Again, we reiterate that external governance is good. A world without
regulatory standards is a terrifying prospect. The free market doesn’t always get
it right, and society imposes constraints on organizations to protect the
consequences of unfettered ambition. We regularly see examples where, even
with tight controls, there is exploitation of the “gray”—that area not quite fully
covered by regulation—or where an industry or product has moved faster than
the regulator can keep up with, to detrimental, damaging, and sometimes life-
threatening effects from the use or the creation of a product or service. There
are always examples of unbudgeted externalities. Externalities can be
considered unpriced goods involved in either consumer or producer market
transactions: the external cost (or benefit) to others. Air pollution from motor
vehicles is one example. The cost of air pollution to society is not paid by
either the producers or users of motorized transport but by all of society.
   The issue arises when we begin to believe (and we’d argue that we’ve become
culturally predisposed to this view) that this sort of governance must be
applied heavily and broadly, from the top down.
   The result of this culture is the creation of an entire industry dedicated to
governance, auditing, and controls. The vast amounts of money being spent on
ensuring governance demands (by, for example, regulators, markets,
shareholders, etc.) have resulted in enormous amounts of power being
concentrated in the hands of auditing services. We see, given this static aspect,
a static governance approach—does anyone remember during the heights of
Covid being demanded, by regulatory bodies, to still physically sign, and have
someone physically witness, a deed?
   So, what choice do organizations have if they want to keep serving their
customers? No wonder the largest consultancy firms around the world have
their roots in audit and compliance work.
   In other words, our relationship with governance is not always healthy. It’s
becoming increasingly necessary to reexamine what we actually want from our
governance and how we can make it work for us.
   Let’s ask a simple question then: why do we want systems that ensure the
work is getting done properly?
   The answer: to reduce risk.
   Kent Beck, Agile Manifesto co-signer and creator of Extreme
Programming8, described it well: “Silence is the sound of risk piling up.”
When we don’t know where work is happening, what work is happening, or
why it’s happening, we invite risk.
   In fact, what is often misunderstood about agile methods and thinking is
that, if applied with discipline, it results in early risk reduction of human
endeavor. Adopting agile is about more effectively managing the risk of change.
This often confounds many new to agile folk—the dichotomy of discipline
with degrees of freedom. If you can see it early, you can manage it: the iterative
nature of agility enables it to serve as an early warning system. We have never
spoken to any leader who didn’t want to see and understand risk early. In
short, it’s the attitude you bring to the problem domain. As Dr. Alistair
Cockburn will often say, “agile is your attitude.”
    What can compound that risk? Delays in elevating information, or wrong
decisions that cause or increase misalignment. There’s a theory that we use
often, that we each make hundreds of decisions or more per day, and that
number has been increasing exponentially over the last decade.9 However, for
the sake of argument, let’s say that individuals in teams make ten decisions
every day that impact the team’s direction. Five days in a week, forty-six
working weeks in a year… that’s 2,300 potentially wrong decisions per person,
per year. Each bad decision compounds upon the last. Add to that a truncated
or delayed information flow, and the impact of those mistakes becomes
exponential. Worse still, the solution is often to turn to the highest-paid person
in the room for an answer to this rapidly accelerating problem… and their
solution is often based on gut feel when they are likely the furthest removed
from the problem itself. Then, just to rub salt in the wound, they’ll propose
additional controls in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, not realizing
that the controls were often the root cause!
    Why does this continue to happen even in purportedly agile organizations?
One argument is that many organizations undergoing agile transformations are
not actually transforming, only becoming transitional. Their “transformations”
are generally concentrated upon changing patterns of work, with the majority
of resources going into the team level. There’s a little left over for the funding
and governing level, and nothing left at all for transforming systems, strategy,
and leadership. Worse still, we often find that the transformations on the team
level versus funding and governing are working in opposition to one another.
The result is a three-tier transformation that results in further misalignment.
Often these transformations are about the people doing the work only—an
unfortunate return to Taylorist thinking—because they must be the problem! If
only people could be more productive, all our issues would be solved… or so
some people would like to believe.
    This is the nature of traditional governance when applied to “hidden” work
like technology and software development. It employs Taylorist, production-
line thinking to what are fundamentally creative endeavors. It assumes that
creating a product is a checklist of processes that can be controlled from the
top down, as opposed to a complex soup of many people making many
decisions. We already know how agile methods work to solve these issues by
elevating and sharing work in short feedback loops to allow for more informed
decision-making, which in turn helps us identify problems quickly, increase
effectiveness, accelerate the pace of delivery, and cut off those compounding
problems before they get out of hand. The processes, systems, and relationships
that assure the work should do the same.
    So yes, we need governance. Specifically, we need governance that allows for
real-time clarity and the dynamic and easily accessible provision of system-
based information. We need faster feedback on risk and compliance concerns.
We need controls that match the way we work instead of adjusting the way we
work to match the controls. Finally, we need to change the conversation
around risk and governance so we can support the expansion of agile ways of
working, instead of constraining agility through inappropriate and ineffective
governance.
