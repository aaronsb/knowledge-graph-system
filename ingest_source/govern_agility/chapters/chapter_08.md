## Chapter 8: Stanchion #3: Patterns of Work

Look over the shoulder of any software engineer and you’ll quickly get a sense
of how they work: their approaches, their toolsets, the ways they track and
verify completion of tasks. Zoom out a little and now watch the entire team at
work. What ways of working are shared by all? What rituals and processes?
How do they communicate, collaborate, celebrate? Zoom out once more, so
you can see an entire department or even a small company achieving their
goals. Where are the patterns emerging? What unites these people in their
pursuit of excellence?
    This combination of teamwork and taskwork as expressed across a wide
breadth of workers—engineers or otherwise—forms what we refer to as
Patterns of Work.
    From a traditional governance perspective, Patterns of Work encompass all
the ways in which teams, individuals, and departments plan projects, comply
with processes, hold to tightly mandated delivery windows, achieve goals, and
how all these concepts vary in accordance with the constraints of time, cost,
and project scope. This way of thinking is fantastic if you’re working in a stable
ecosystem with very little change on the horizon. You can create a work
package designed for a single outcome and execute it precisely. But it all falls
apart when you need to create a model of continuous delivery that flexes to
match changes in the environment and the needs of customers. In our
modern, VUCA world, these windows of change have contracted significantly.
Back in the 1990s, you had three to four years to respond to market shifts.
Today? Six months, if you’re lucky. How often have you seen new strategic
opportunities or challenges emerge before we’ve managed a response to the
crisis of the moment?1
    High performing agile organizations, on the other hand, allow teams to
define their own localized ways of working. They build safe spaces where teams
can exchange ideas, experiment with processes, and allow individualized
toolsets and approaches to flourish. This isn’t to say that those teams operate
without constraints. They still work beneath the umbrella of organizational
structures and patterns required to ensure overarching strategic alignment. But
the how is decided upon at the team level.
   When traditional governance reigns, these safe spaces are often limited to
specific teams or departments. You’re all probably familiar with organizations
where a handful of agile teams are highly successful in defining their own ways
of working, but that permission to experiment is constrained. What could
become fantastic new patterns of work across the breadth of an organization
are locked down to pilot teams or artificially hobbled by middle-management
compliance with a systemic bent to control.
   We already know how effective these new ways of working can be in a
VUCA environment. It’s governance that needs to change by

          Distributing permission for individuals and teams to discover their
      own, localized ways of working;
           Moving away from mandated processes and towards high-level
      guided intent;
          Instead of providing teams with designed ways of working, seeking
      to understand and verify the question, “Have you intelligently designed
      for the work that needs to be done?”;
           Providing guide rails to gently nudge people towards ways of
      working that suit their teams, goals, and customers;
          Creating environments where people feel safe to experiment with
      new patterns of work, and where failures are considered learning
      opportunities.

    Easier said than done, of course. Leave teams with complete freedom to
design their own patterns of work, and they may create something that’s highly
effective for them but clashes with the rest of the organization, hindering
communication and productivity across the horizontal. Tighten the guide rails
too much, and you have the opposite problem: organic patterns of work
become stifled, with no way to devolve across teams and departments.
    So how can we create new systems of work that allow for and encourage
these high-productivity patterns of work? Or, considering that your systems of
work will be highly individualized and molded to your organization in
extremely specific ways, what markers or signposts should we look for in our
systems of work that let us know we’re on the right track?
   There are four essential imperatives to encourage:
Design for Flow
If you want to get the most out of a tank of petrol, hit the highway and stay on
cruise control. Similarly, if you want to create value more efficiently, make sure
your teams are working steadily at an optimal rate.
    We see huge inefficiencies arise when teams stop and start, stop and start,
thanks to lags and delays between projects, getting stuck at bottlenecks, poor
information flow, or delayed decision-making. When knowledge workers are
on the deck and the payroll, you want to keep them working. This might
sound like cold economics, but it’s demonstrable that passionate engineers
thrive when they’re working on projects that they’re passionate about and in
ways that allow them to express that passion. Nobody enjoys spinning their
wheels, and team morale suffers as a result.
    What we need is a steady, managed, and prioritized flow of work stemming
from customer needs. Organizations are increasingly recognizing this need and
thinking in terms of Flow, not just as a process but as a philosophy of work. To
which some say: What took you so long? Toyota has been developing the
Toyota Production System (TPS) and the Toyota Way for over half a century.
Honda, Porsche, and most other major automotive manufacturers have
followed suit. The Toyota Way, and offshoots, aren’t limited to manufacturing:
it has since been built upon and extended into software development and
organization design thanks to the guidance of heavyweights like Don
Reinertsen (Product Development Flow) and Mary & Tom Poppendieck (Lean
Software Development).
    A more broadly applicable adaptation of this way of thinking is The Flow
System, which is an evolution of Lean Thinking. The Flow System2 was
developed as a framework by Turner, Thurlow and Rivera in 2019 to
“[provide] a re-imagined system for organizations to understand complexity,
embrace teamwork, and autonomous team-based leadership structures.”
    The Flow System resonates across a broad spectrum because of how it
incorporates complexity thinking. This takes the core, successful foundations
of Lean and TPS and uses them as a guiding pattern for domains that aren’t
linear, predictable, or deterministic.
    Don’t have time to dive deep into the Flow System? Don’t worry. We’ll
explore how to design for flow in a nutshell.
   The first step is to adopt Value Chains and Value Stream Mapping across
the entire organization. We won’t go into depth in this book about Value
Stream Management and Value Stream Mapping, however, we consider them
fundamental to governing any system of work or executing a transformation.
Think of it as the evolution of process mapping with a customer-first lens
applied to creative or knowledge work, which is often hidden work. You can’t
see the knowledge worker flow of activity the way you can see a factory floor.
   Yes, Value Chains are now commonplace in many teams. But do these ways
of thinking extend throughout the hierarchy to touch all levels of governance?
Can people three or four steps removed from the work (and the customers)
accurately visualize the flow of work through the system? Do knowledge
workers have complete visibility into interdependencies and bottlenecks that
exist outside their own teams?
   Take the fundamental principles of Value Stream Mapping and expand it.
Look not just at the work being done, but at how the organization functions to
get value into the hands of its customers. Only then can you ensure that
customer needs are being translated into prioritized, initiative-level, strategic
backlogs, and given to the right teams with the right resources at the right
times. Only then can you create flow.
Distribute Decision-Making
Every system of work is contingent on decisions. Some are almost insignificant,
a part of the approximately 35,000 we make every day. Do I choose stripes for
today’s Zoom catchup or plaid? Will my executive stakeholders notice I’m
wearing Bermuda shorts if I accidentally stand up on camera? While some will
affect the work we do, and the outcomes we achieve, day by day translating
into large cumulative impact over time. Others affect those around us in more
significant ways: decisions regarding group processes, the way we
communicate, and the direction or prioritization of projects.
    One person (or one team) can only make so many large-scale decisions per
day. Information needs to be gathered, processed, organized, and considered.
Opinions need to be debated. When we funnel decisions into the hands of
only a few, or create systems where decisions have to be filtered up through
layers of hierarchy and then back down to the teams actually doing the work,
we create terrible bottlenecks. The process grinds to a halt.
   And we can’t afford that. Not in a VUCA world.
   Agile systems require agile decision-making. That means fast, flexible, and,
most importantly, distributed decision-making. And to do so, we must build
systems of governance that not only enable that distribution but give people
the knowledge and tools they need to make the right decisions at the right
times. Build trust in people, and design the systems simply to verify the work.
   This is the only way to enable a constant and high-speed flow of work. It
gives us the capacity for expedient directional decisions, timely interventions,
and pivot-point decisions, without the need to double and triple-check with
layers upon layers of hierarchy.
   Agile and lean ways of working aim for a “close in person, place, and time”
method of decision-making. This allows for the necessary decisions to be made
conclusively by the people closest to the work, closest to the time that the
decision is required, and closest to the mess created by our complex, adaptive
systems. Agile Governance asks us to examine how this affects methods of
leadership. When decisions are in the hands of smaller teams and individuals,
how do leaders enable this? How can they encourage bold decisions? How do
they build the guide rails which ensure smart decisions are being made, and
that people can learn from and build upon their mistakes? And how might
they know when to step back versus when to lean in?
   Failure tolerance is important, too. Leaders make mistakes. If you’re not
building tolerance for failure into the model, then the system will snap back at
the first sign of failure. We can conceptually move accountability down the
organizational chart, but not in practice, as when something goes wrong our
society and culture call for a senior person to be held accountable. For optics.
   The bigger the organization, and the bigger the stakeholder set, the harder
this gets.
   It’s not enough to hand the reins of decision-making to teams of hundreds,
if not thousands, of workers and expect everything to sort itself out. The
accompanying governance must support these new paradigms.
Clarity of Purpose and Intent
What is the purpose of your teams? Not just to create products or work
through backlogs, but their ultimate purpose. Do they know what they’re
working towards, or what their efforts will achieve? Do they understand the
intent of their leaders, and of their leaders’ leaders? Do you know what it is
that you must do? In the Art of Action3 Stephen Bungay explores how the most
pressing problem in most large-scale organizations today is clarity of outcomes
and the ability to align people to that end while ensuring the right level of
autonomy across hierarchies. Aligned Autonomy—a property of agile teams
adopted by Spotify to great success—helps to enable this clarity of mission.
    Given the increasingly VUCA business environment and the collapse of
annual planning cycles and fixed three-year strategies, agile organizations have
increasingly embraced dynamic strategic planning in response to change. Life,
and strategic planning, is a constant game of making decisions based on
incomplete information. The goal of strategic thinking, or the thought process
for deciding which markets to compete in and how, is about trying to
assimilate boundless information and make decisions that ensure the
company’s survival.
    However, governance practices aren’t necessarily keeping pace. Purpose and
intent are changing but the flow of information isn’t fast enough. As a result,
organizations can’t adapt and transform their structure in ways that help to
execute strategic change, and so aren’t keeping abreast of the organization’s
outcomes.
    Instead, we need to ensure strategy is being decomposed down to the team
level. After all, structure follows strategy. We know it in our hearts, but are we
internalizing it? Are we building governance to enable it? Are we working to
understand how our teams are organized, how their work flows and delivers,
and how that aligns with larger strategic needs?
    In short, if you want your teams ready and willing to adjust patterns of
work to suit the larger organizational intent, you have to do more than ensure
that intent is transparent. You have to broadcast it loud and clear.
The Team Codifies its Way of Working
As teams become increasingly agile and adapt their ways of working to suit
complex, changing environments, they build stores of specialized knowledge
that can’t be easily transferred. Their methods of communication,
prioritization, and collections of bespoke tools and processes might be
exceptionally effective, but passing that wisdom on to others? That’s a trickier
task.
   To correct this, persistent teams should make regular efforts to codify the
ways in which they work. Their processes should be described, explored, and
shared. Their best ideas should be made transparent and held up to scrutiny.
    There are, of course, different types of work and different domains of
problems. We don’t advocate a one-size-fits-all Way of Working. It never
works. Instead, we advocate having core pillars that cross the organization and
align the work, while allowing localized creation as to how that work is created
(a return to the Aligned Autonomy paradigm).
    This achieves a number of things. It helps spread knowledge across
organizations and allows teams to clearly compare and contrast their ways of
working. This builds safe spaces for the distribution and development of new
ideas, and an atmosphere of continuous improvement. In fact, there’s a well-
known axiom in the Toyota Production System related to this and attributed to
founder Taiichi Ohno: “Without standard work there can be no kaizen
(improvement).”
    It also allows stakeholders, suppliers, and customers an insight into how the
sausage is made. In Software Development, and much of the 21st century
knowledge-based industry, this is critical but because it is often hidden work,
there’s no way to see the factory floor. Opening up that floor means more
accurately providing those teams with the resources and other support to
ensure the organization meets its goals. Just as importantly, it allows the team’s
methods, their IP and frameworks, to persist after people move on from the
team.
    With these four imperatives firmly in place, is it wise to simply stand back
and let the teams build their own patterns of work, communications,
codification, and so on? Not necessarily. Even in a highly agile, highly
autonomous environment, guide rails are a must. Think of them less as
constraints and more as codified signposts that help autonomous teams know
they’re heading in the right direction. This also functions as an assurance
mechanism.
    Models like the Remote Agility Framework, which we discuss in greater
detail in Chapters 12.1-12.5, can help accomplish this. They support teams in
understanding the larger goals, strategy and direction, and how to get the work
done. This frees them up to figure out the what: the actual ways they’ll be
getting the work done on the ground. Using patterns like the Remote Agility
Framework also gives confidence to leaders (and the larger organizational
mindset) that they can stand back and trust the teams, the people closest to the
work and the customer, to know best how they work and how the work gets
done the best.
   In the same manner, teams will understand better than anyone which
information they need to thrive, and which information is superfluous. We’ve
discussed transparency and radical openness in communication before, but
that doesn’t mean that every team needs to know everything all the time. In
fact, absolute transparency (from a cost and time perspective) is almost
impossible.
   This means that trusting teams to do the work also means trusting them to
seek out the information they need from inside a transparent system, instead of
forcing it upon them.
   As per Team Topologies: “Many organizations assume that more
communication is always better, but this is not really the case. What we need is
focused communications between specific teams.” 4
Dynamic Re-teaming When Your Environment Changes
Once you have the methods, they are not static. That’s also the essence of
agility: responding to change is, after all, one of the core values of agile and
that applies to your ways of working. Many organizations are learning this and
seeing the value in building organizational competency for re-design and re-
launching of teams when the strategy changes, opportunities arise, or the thing
you are working towards solving moves from novel to known and the work
changes in nature, maybe becoming repeatable, and can be executed
differently.
    This can mean becoming a candidate for increased automation and even the
use of machine learning to take on more and more of the human activity,
which means needing to change how you work and how you govern that new
system of work. It happens at different levels, from the small, localized team
right up to the business unit. In our view, you always need to consider whether
you are organized in the right way to solve your problems most efficiently and
effectively, and whether your operating model is right for the same reasons.
This holds true for how you govern your systems of work. As you apply change
to your operating and teaming models, it will apply pressure to how you
govern the system, requiring you to adapt in response.
    What we see more often than not, though, is that it doesn’t happen. The
work gets harder to execute, layers of process and process governance are added
where they’re not needed, and the system slows down. Being able to change
your operating and teaming model is a core capability that is often missed and
ends up the province of consulting firms. In a VUCA world, our view is that
you need strong internal transformation capability so that you can be
constantly inspecting and adapting your own ways of working to avoid the big
bang transformations of the past. If you’re not moving forward then you’re
going backwards, because your competition does not stand still.
Knowing your Methods Matters
When you boil all these concepts down, you’re left with a series of questions to
ask of yourself and your governance methodologies. Consider: are you using
the ways your teams are organized to guide your strategy, or vice-versa? How
does your governance allow for teams to seek and obtain the information they
need? Do they have clarity of purpose and a clear flow of work so they can
accurately determine what it is they need to know and when? Have you built
systems that allow teams the authority to make relevant, timely decisions and
move forward on projects without losing time and energy to approval
processes?
   Or is everyone struggling through a sea of residual control mechanisms that
are slowly and silently devaluing and reverting your agile transformations?
