## Chapter 15: Get Out There and Make it Happen

Throughout this book we have referred to the writings and thoughts of Dr.
Alistair Cockburn, creator of the Heart of Agile and one of the original
seventeen co-authors of the Agile Manifesto, from which many of our ideas
originate. Alistair has often discussed how much of a fluke of nature it was that
a collection of curmudgeon software developers were the ones to decode the
nature of knowledge work and what it took to work effectively, just in time for
the Cambrian explosion of a digital-centric world.
    The Agile Manifesto was signed in 2001—over 22 years ago. It’s taken over
two decades for the knowledge of how to work better and more humanely in
the software and technology sphere to propagate and expand outward, beyond
the coding of a website, to the management of people and systems. Yet, many
organizations we work with are still working through foundational arguments
such as:
    “Agile isn’t necessarily for everything.”
    “Do you mean little ‘a’ or big ‘A’?”
    “Agile is just for technology.”
    These things are now table stakes, the bare minimum to get you into the
game. Every technology is driven by software, so every company could be
considered a technology company if you reflect on Marc Andreesen’s famous
quote, “Software is eating the world”1.
    When we butt up against these discussions, we’re forced to ask: what
industry do these people think they’re in? What game do they think they’re
playing? We’ve also observed that, when people get caught up in debates about
agility and its relevance to modern business, the arguments are rooted in ego,
status, and control. Being able to respond quickly in a complex world requires
people to give up certain types of control, and that’s a difficult ask. We say yes
to governance that controls the way decisions are made. Controlling the
decisions themselves, though? That’s a recipe for disaster.
    Despite the resistance from certain organizations, we believe these concepts
will continue to spread and percolate over time. There’s a theory on the
evolution of ideas and disruptive products that it takes thirty to forty years—
maybe even fifty—from the genesis of a new idea to its commoditization. If we
double back to Chapter 2 and the story of Copernicus (analogous to the story
of the Customer Digital Revolution), you might recall that it wasn’t until well
after death that his ideas started to be broadly adopted, and then refuted. To
follow from this thought, Steve Denning—to whom we have referred often
throughout this book—has stated that agile and agility have become a
management revolution over the last twenty years, especially in the last ten. As
such, it’s not surprising that such a gap in knowledge, experience, and
adoption of agile exists in the governance of work.
    There’s no such thing as an overnight success, and we are only at the very
start of the agile revolution. It might be true that most organizations will say,
“We are agile,” while only thinking of their technology functions. The 2022
State of Agile Report declares that, amongst their respondents, there’s an
inherent bias amongst the agile community towards saying yes to questions
like these: “80% of them are using agile as their predominant approach.”
    If we take these numbers at face value, it’s fair to say that agile has crossed
the chasm in this business and industry domain. However, outside the tech
world, agile is still at the early majority stage, and so is business agility
thinking. The industry has not yet explored how to inject agility into systems
of governance, because it’s only now becoming mainstream at an enterprise
level.
Buying a Ferrari and Driving like a Lada
At the beginning of this book, we noted that not using agile in your
governance systems was like being given the keys to a Ferrari and never getting
out of first gear. You’ve got the car. You know how it can perform. You feel the
power when the engine rumbles. You’re stuck on a four-lane highway with
back-to-back traffic, and all your focus goes into trying not to stall. Not to
mention that as the driver of a red Ferrari everybody else on the highway is
watching you. You’ve made the investments, you’ve got the stories to tell, the
culture is shifting, and people can see you drive past! They want to be in the
passenger seat beside you, going along for the ride. Yet you can’t make that ride
fulfill its true potential.
    Your organization may already be that Ferrari. Maybe it’s in the process of
becoming one. However, you’ll never be able to leverage the true power of your
teams and leaders if you don’t unshackle them from traditional governance.
Regardless of where you are on your journey, it’s important to observe Agile
Governance principles: whether you’re trying to strip back heavy governance
processes preventing your teams from achieving what they could, or trying to
introduce additional governance as your business grows up. To do so requires
actively thinking about the system of work, the things you need to respond to
internally, externally, and purposefully, and trying to do it all in a more flexible
and adaptive way… while ensuring you comply with policies intended to
protect the organization. It’s no small task.
    This challenge is at the heart of why and how we proposed and crafted the
five stanchions of Agile Governance. The intent is to give you structure,
guidance, and certainty, while allowing space for adaptation, emergence, and
change—all things needed to survive in the digital age. To allow you to retain
control, yet harness variability for your gain. We talk about it being scaffolding
for you to build and design your own, bespoke operating model and system.
That scaffolding, although built upon strong stanchions, still needs to be
created in a way that suits the context of your organization and the customer’s
problems. To recap those stanchions:

![Figure](images/page-009.png)


       1. Conductive Leadership: Everything starts with leadership, and 21st-
       century leadership is required to solve 21st century problems. Often you
       find an organization that has combined 19th century management with
       20th century technology, and the combination completely fails when
       pitted against the problems of the modern age. As such, leaders need to
       rethink how they lead, and especially how they can move away from
       task and management focus to one more adaptive, guiding and
       enabling. To coaching rather than driving, so to speak. Conductive
       leadership is best envisioned through the metaphor of the leader as
       conductor of the orchestra. Yes, the musicians are following a score. Yes,
       your people are well trained and capable in their roles. Everyone is
       heading towards the same goal. Even so, a conductor is required to
       ensure everybody is fulfilling their role at the right point in time,
       individually or collectively. That’s modern leadership. And it has the
       potential to produce magical music!
2. Sensible Transparency: The stanchion of Sensible Transparency is
about how you can have the right information available at the right time
to make the right decisions. At its heart, agile is about increasing the
speed of decision-making and how quickly you can move an idea from
the original idea holder to the idea executor. This is how we retool large,
slow systems of work to be as nimble as their smaller competitors. We
need this level of speed and transparency because, at the end of the day,
customer value drives revenue and profitability, and both are under
attack by disruptive players in every industry. This all must be achieved
while remaining wary of creating too much transparency, which can
overwhelm and introduce paralysis. Use this stanchion to find the
balance between providing enough transparency to provide value, and
inundating people with too many dashboards.
3. Patterns of Work: All work requiring more than one person to reach
an outcome needs to be done collaboratively, which means you need to
think about how you’ve designed that work. Everything is a process.
Some schools of thought in the agile community believe process is a
dirty word. Not true! We want processes that create consistency where
needed but allow teams to describe how they want to operate locally to
solve their problems. Leadership and management must make the
decisions on setting those enabling constraints, while allowing points of
variation that empower people to design, to the greatest extent possible,
how they work to solve problems. In this manner, patterns of work are
created that cascade throughout the organization and allow the other
stanchions to operate. It’s a critical foundational stanchion to the
successful injection of agility into your governance.
4. Data Driven Reasoning: Start everything with data, even if you’re
not sure of the accuracy! So long as you can get information that is
directionally correct, will provide value, and you know will improve
over time, it’s beneficial and can drive useful conversations. At the very
least, people will ask questions around the data itself and take ownership
to improve it. Too many times now we’ve seen organizations failing to
put the lens on themselves when it comes to performance, and
consistently using data to inform decision-making. If you choose not to
do this, you’ll remain blind to whether or not you even have improved.
      You’ll be unable to determine whether improvement efforts should
      continue, pause, pivot, or even stop. Standard operating procedures still
      remain highly valuable in some elements of work, particularly where
      problems are repeatable, or you intend to automate. The key is where
      and how to apply it to design your system of work so that the data you
      elevate from these different patterns has value.
      5. Humanity as the Cornerstone: Continuing to keep people at the
      core is critical to the enablement of an agile organization, let alone
      injecting agility into your governance. Many organizations are moving
      towards customer centricity, putting customers at the heart of their
      strategy and development. When discussing humanity as the
      cornerstone of governance, we like to refer to Richard Branson. He’s
      stated that Virgin is special because he puts people at the center;
      empowered, happy, and engaged staff who are appreciated for their
      work are the real differentiators in a creative world. So, make sure that
      when you design your Agile Governance system, it’s about enabling
      people as much as it is meeting the needs from a stakeholder, regulator,
      industry, or society. If in doubt, refer back to the opening statements of
      the Agile Manifesto: “We are uncovering better ways of developing software
      by doing it and helping others do it.”

    The Stanchions create glue between these concepts and your own
governance. That doesn’t mean that you can incorporate stanchion-thinking
and then stand still. Continuous improvement is a key aspect of Agile
Governance. Yes, the stanchions are fixed. They have solid foundations you
should organize around. However, the world doesn’t stand still, so you need to
make sure that your approach allows for flexibility when something inevitably
shifts.
    That’s why what we’ve given you a selection of industry practices around
how you might inspect and adapt the processes and stanchions to suit your
organization. As the environment moves and things change, you should be
constantly re-visiting what you have put in place and considering how best to
allow your Agile Governance ecosystem to meet your needs. Evolving practices
and processes are at the Heart of Agile, and that extends to Agile Governance.
What is normal?
The next normal is coming. In fact, by the time you’ve recognized the “next
normal,” it’s probably already the current normal. If you want to be ready for
these continuous waves of change, you need to seriously examine your
governance now! To thrive, you’ll need to consider an intentional
organizational design that creates or enhances collaborative connective tissues
in order to enable communication, information flow, and increased speed of
directional decisions.
   With the advent of COVID-19, we saw that our idea of normal can be
disrupted at any moment. In fact, there is no normal. There is only change.
Even if you think you’re stabilized and comfortable, something or someone
will eventually disrupt it. The modern VUCA world won’t allow you to paddle
in place.
   So, when it comes to change, you can make changes piecemeal, or you can
look at how the system is governed as a whole. Agile Governance enables this.
However, only you can turn it from theory into reality.
   Get out there. Examine your systems of governance critically. Look at them
through the lens of the five stanchions.
                                     Remember:
                       Don’t apply governance to your agile.
                         Apply agility to your governance!
