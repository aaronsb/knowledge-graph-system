## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our deep gratitude to the founders of Elabor8, Nam
Huynh, Paul Velonis, and Andrew Blain, for affording us the opportunity to
begin refining our ideas and perspectives. For furthering that journey, we
would also like to extend our gratitude to John Tooth, the CEO of the Remote
Agility Framework, and Andrew Blain, the founder of the Remote Agility
Framework, who provided us with the opportunity to build on those ideas on
an international stage.
    We have learned from, worked closely with, and stayed in close contact
with Alistair Cockburn over the years. His thinking and approach to people
and work, his openness and willingness to always have a conversation about
agile is something that we deeply cherish.
    Dr. Amy Silver is another person whom we have taken a lot of our thinking
on how to create an agile environment by encouraging people to be brave and
face change. She has also provided some guidance on how we go about getting
to this published stage, giving her time freely, and we thank her for that.
    Our thanks go to Craig Smith, who encouraged us to take the talk we had
presented at Agile Australia and write this book from it. Craig and Tony grew
up in agile together, and he has not only been a friend and confidant to us;
without his review and encouragement, this book would never have reached
completion.
    Phil Abernathy, we have learned so many lessons from you both in agility
and how to apply it in an organizational sense. It was you that provided the
catalyst of thinking about looking at the entire system and how it is governed.
We are eternally grateful for your countenance and mentoring over the years.
    The thinking of the wonderful Esther Derby has influenced us greatly.
Having had the opportunity to talk, work, and interview her over the last few
years, we have learned much about the thinking of the organizational system as
a whole and the integral interactions that enable and disable the governing of
the system as a whole. We are forever grateful.
    We have spent time, though not nearly enough, over a cold beer in a Fitzroy
pub talking about how the Business Agility Institute shapes out organizational
agile thinking with Evan Leybourn, the co-founder of the Global Business
Agility Institute. Evan’s unique and somewhat rare grasp on what makes
enterprise-level agility has been something we draw from and look forward to
contributing back to!
   We can’t forget to recognize who we rate as one of the true fathers of
Australian agile, the erstwhile Craig Brown. Craig is the co-founder of the
Australian Lean Agile Systems Thinking Conference and has been in this
domain for eons. If you ever want to test an idea, ask Craig. He’ll have a view
or an opinion that invariably gets you thinking more and helps shape your
direction. He is another one of those folk who will always have time for a beer
and a conversation.
   The Australian agile community is one of the most open and sharing
communities to be found anywhere. It truly is a broad church where any ideas
can be surfaced and trialled, and generally any person involved is willing to
share their story of agile transformation—what worked, what didn’t, and what
did we learn? Interacting with this group has broadened our horizons and
provided us with the ability to give back, and it’s one that we have chosen to be
a close part of for well over a decade. Special thanks to Chris Chan, Rachel
Slattery,
   Ed Wong, Alexandra Stokes, Peter Lam, Steven Lawrence, Paul Caon,
Adina Thavsin, Renee Troughton, Dave Martin, James McMennamin, Phil
Grech, Martin Kearns, Sandy Mamoli, Shane Hastie, Farnaz Vahab, Nikola
Peters, and Nish Mahanty.
   A big thank you goes to Chris Hayes-Kossman for helping us find our
writing style, get our ideas out, and keep us moving forward.
   Over the years of agile going from a revolution in software delivery to now
enterprise management, the one global author who has kept his finger on the
change is Steve Denning. We drew on his research as a source for where the
agile market trends towards.
   In our view, the leading thinker globally on complexity theory in
organizations is Dave Snowden, the founder and chief scientific officer of The
Cynefin Company, specializing in complexity and sensemaking. Reading the
paper he co-published in 2007, A Leader’s Framework for Decision-Making, was
a pivotal point in how we view how organizations solve different types of
problems and how leaders need different styles and approaches to navigate
those problems. We have referenced and adopted the Cynefin Framework
extensively over the years.
   Brian Rivera, John Turner, and Nigel Thurlow are the co-authors of The
Flow System. Their approach to enabling systems of work to better deliver
customer value, emerging from the roots of the Toyota Production System and
Lean, is something we resonate with.
    We have had the pleasure over the years of reading, interviewing, and
talking with Stephen Bungay, L. David Marquet, and Christopher Avery, and
it would be remiss not to acknowledge their influences on our thought
processes.
    We can’t end our acknowledgements without recognising the other sixteen
original authors of The Agile Manifesto, alongside Alistair Cockburn. We are
reasonably confident that the gathering in February 2001 at The Lodge at
Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah didn’t predict the
impact they would have, not only on how to develop software but also on how
to run organizations that are filled with knowledge workers. And we are forever
grateful that they did.
    We truly stand on the shoulders of giants.
