## Chapter 10: Stanchion #5: Humanity as the Cornerstone

Traditional governance seeks predictability, stability, security. It’s static, slow to
respond to change, and generally unwieldy. As such, it can’t be effective unless
the existing systems stay static as well. Traditional governance is also often a
very linear process, with long delays between opportunities for sharing
information and feedback. This time delay, in turn, leads to the need to
generate excessive amounts of information. We’re all familiar with the mantra,
“Less is more.” Well, in traditional governance, more is more. None of this is
suitable for the modern VUCA world, in which long-term success thrives on
fast feedback.
    Compliance and regulation demand strict adherence to statutory processes
and mandates. Many of the industries we work with are heavily regulated by
government entities, with specific goals of preserving the norms of society.
Take for example the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. “The
Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is an independent
statutory authority that supervises institutions across banking, insurance and
superannuation and promotes financial system stability in Australia.”1
    If you want to understand the constraints placed on organizations by
regulators, which give rise to governance approaches and standards, start by
examining what the Industry Regulator seeks to achieve. For example, “APRA’s
role is to protect the Australian community by establishing and enforcing
legally binding standards that apply to these APRA-regulated entities. In
supervising these institutions, APRA seeks to ensure these entities carefully (or
prudently) manage their businesses in order to protect the interests, in
particular, of bank depositors, insurance policyholders, and superannuation
members. APRA’s primary mandate is to ensure that APRA-regulated entities
have sufficient financial means to meet their obligations to customers: that
deposits are safe; that insurers have sufficient funds to pay claims; and that
superannuation trustees are managing people’s money well. APRA does this by
focusing, as much as possible, on preventing harm before it occurs, and by
taking pre-emptive action when problems are identified.”
    This means that the Regulator has a key role to play in system-wide
governance. Their goal is system stability and consumer protection, but at the
least possible cost, and not in all circumstances. They aim to avoid overly
prescriptive regulation that prevents business from taking place. Ironically,
there are specific examples where regulation is actually removing humanity,
such as in aged care provision. One bad apple creates administration for a
whole industry, the job ceases to be about caring for people, and instead it
becomes about ticking boxes.
    What does this mean when you throw one hundred, one thousand or even
one hundred thousand people into the mix, all with differing opinions,
motivations, histories, ethical foundations, and methodologies? You can begin
to understand why many systems of governance seem to want to minimize or
strip away the humanity of their teams. There are Prudential Standards,
Prudential Guidelines and Reporting Standards… and not much that is
human centric. In fact, many systems of Governance eschew the carrot and
instead use a stick based on these regulatory/compliance standards to expedite
or block work, which in turn creates unnecessary tension.
    In our experience, if you approach these regulatory bodies with a plan to
meet their requirements through a more human lens, you may find that they’re
more fluid than you expected. This is a humanistic approach of “intent versus
permission”, rather than the traditional governing methods of “just get it done
and ignore the impacts to the organization and its people”.
    Agile Governance, on the other hand, sees humanity as the cornerstone of
good business. It values humanistic methods of governance over the more
mechanistic, rule-based and non-adaptive methods, which aligns with the
Agile Manifesto valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
It values individuality, and seeks to encourage and enhance the unique
characteristics, skills, and viewpoints that each person brings to the table.
Concepts like trust, responsibility, democracy, fairness, and humility are core
to human systems. There are specific examples where the regulator of an
industry will meet with the regulated to work through the intent and
application of the regulation, and then verify adoption. This happens often in
banking and insurance, for instance. We would view this as a more human
approach: seeking to collaborate effectively given that our goals should be
aligned.
    We would argue that this isn’t an alternative to traditional governance so
much as it is the only way to create effective governance. You can’t legislate the
humanity out of humans. Apply all the mechanistic controls you like:
processes, standardization, phase-gating, micro-task allocation, management,
and so on. Humans will always be the blip in the radar, the ghost in the
machine. The more you attempt to stifle or strip out the human element, the
worse your governance becomes: more rigid, stratified, and more likely to
crumble once it clashes against any complexity. These forms of governance
aren’t emergent, adaptive, nor responsive—it’s the people who bring that ability
to respond, adapt, and embrace variation.
    Transitioning to a human-centric system of governance doesn’t change the
fundamental goals of that system: the intent and the outcome. The why of
setting practices and methods to control and report on work is also unchanged.
We want to change the how and the what, and even then, we’re not asking for
a complete reinvention. Just a shift, a little jump to the left. Some of the how
will still be constrained by the same requirements and regulations, and the
what will be guided by enabling constraints. Some of these constraints may be
preventative. Others may give structure and guidance to your new Governance
model. Yet, inside these constraints, we allow people to explore what is needed
to meet these requirements while minimizing what is not. This is, in the words
of Pat Reed2 (and commonly used in Lean parlance), a quest for Minimal
Viable Everything.
    This is why we’re so intent on finding the people who actually do the work
and enabling them to become the true governance custodians of the system.
They’re the ones who know what the customer wants, how to give them what
they need, what the needs of the system are, and how to best enable one
another to deliver. We don’t set them adrift without a compass. Instead, we set
out clear conditions and constraints and allow people the space to meet them
in varying ways. So long as the outcome is achieved within these boundaries,
everyone is happy. This flexibility, this agility, is critical because the nature of
modern work varies so much and so quickly. Trying to place prohibitive
governance on an exploratory problem domain invites failure. Trying to have
light governance and controls in highly regulated industries that require near-
zero fault tolerance will also invite failure.
    When we discuss what placing humanity at the cornerstone of good
governance entails, a common reaction is: what about oversight? Can’t you see
the risks in simply handing over the keys to the entire system?
   That’s not what we’re advocating for at all. Oversight is a necessity in any
system. However, it should be lightweight and supportive, as opposed to
unwieldy and restrictive to the point of choking the system and becoming an
obstacle to work. It also needs inherent variability in the problem domain it’s
trying to secure. We want to change the understanding of oversight to one
based first and foremost in trust. That means trusting in the training, coaching,
guide rails, and data-collection systems as well. It means changing the controls
so that when teams are audited (or audit themselves), they’re measuring against
things that matter.
   All of this combines into a governance system where teams have faith in the
information at hand, can confidently make directional decisions and provide
their intent to leadership, and where established systems collect and report data
continuously.
   When a system like this is in place and working well, leaders can apply the
“trust but verify” approach, popularized during the Reagan era of political
management. There is an inherent need for leaders to do their due diligence
and confirm the facts. But this doesn’t imply a lack of trust in their workers. In
fact, it creates an understanding that trust is a bi-directional flow of
information.
Trust in People
None of this can happen unless we ensure that the people doing the work have
the right levels of guide rails, clarity, competence, and capabilities. Where
everyone has inherent trust that the people beside them, above them, and
below them are doing the right thing.
    This approach is complementary to “Leading with Intent”, discussed in
Chapter 6, Conductive Leadership. In fact, this stanchion has a symbiotic
relationship with the other stanchions in that all of them must be in place for
it to be effective, and they in turn require it for their own success.
