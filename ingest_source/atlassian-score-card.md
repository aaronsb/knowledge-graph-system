Why Score System of Work Adoption?
In most enterprise organizations, working together is harder than it should be.

Leaders often lack confidence that teams are focused on the most important work.

Teams are overwhelmed by meetings, messages, and competing priorities—leaving them busy but not always productive.

Cross-functional collaboration suffers when teams are misaligned.

And while AI can help close these gaps, the foundation needed to unlock its value is often missing.

At Cprime, we see System of Work as a smart evolution of proven coordination practices grounded in research and real-world experience—making them simpler, lighter, and accessible to all teams, not just those that adopt scaling frameworks like SAFe and Jira Align. Our longstanding mission to help teams optimize their operating model aligns directly to its pillars.

Yet, while the benefits of System of Work are clear to Atlassian and Cprime, they are often overlooked by customers who remain product-focused and miss the broader value of the platform. These customers miss how the System of Work improves how teams plan, align, and deliver work. They also overlook how its structured approach enables AI by feeding high-quality data into the Teamwork Graph. The same disciplined practices that drive alignment also generate the structured data Rovo needs to produce meaningful, context-aware insights.

As AI adoption accelerates across Atlassian’s platform, understanding how practice maturity supports AI outcomes is critical.  Scoring System of Work adoption reveals both practice maturity and AI-readiness. By identifying adoption patterns and anti-patterns ("practice smells"), we can:

Identify key blockers to higher team performance and greater platform ROI

Uncover product and platform gaps that hinder adoption

Target service offerings faster and more precisely to better align team practices with Atlassian’s platform vision—and accelerate ROI.

AI-Optimization Score Details
This scorecard’s scoring model is based on the structure and intent of Atlassian’s System of Work Practices guide, which distills Atlassian’s most mature thinking on how modern teams plan, track, and align their work—and provides a shared reference point familiar to both Cprime and Atlassian stakeholders.

To evaluate progress against these principles, we extended the original guidance into a measurable framework. Each challenge described in the guide has been reframed as a maturity capability or strategic behavior—transforming “what goes wrong” into “what high-performing teams do right.” Each of these capabilities is then expressed as a key question, with supporting signals that help quantify whether the behavior is being consistently demonstrated.

This approach allows us to maintain fidelity to Atlassian’s vision while introducing actionable criteria that support both assessment and improvement.

Recommended Actions
Cprime or Atlassian should consider creating dashboards for:

System of Work: showing Goals, Roadmap, Priorities, and Ability to Execute (and make it the home page for every Atlassian user!) (see screenshot below)

Oversight: showing scorecards for each pillar (based on this report!), making recommendations for improvements (and provide Automations/Agents that can help fix any problems).
