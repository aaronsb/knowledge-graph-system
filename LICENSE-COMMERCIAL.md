# Commercial Licensing

The Knowledge Graph System is available under the **Elastic License 2.0** for most use cases. This license allows:

✅ **Free for individuals** - Homelab, learning, experimentation
✅ **Free for companies** - Internal use at any scale
✅ **Free for product integration** - Incorporate into your own products

❌ **Not permitted** - Offering as "Knowledge Graph as a Service" to third parties for a fee

## When You Need a Commercial License

You need a commercial license if you want to:

- Provide the Knowledge Graph System as a **managed service** to third parties
- Offer **hosted access** to the platform's features for external users
- Build a **SaaS product** where the core functionality is the knowledge graph system

## Use Cases That Don't Require a Commercial License

You **do not** need a commercial license for:

- **Internal company use** - Deploy for your own organization's knowledge management
- **Product integration** - Incorporate the graph system into your own software product (as long as the knowledge graph functionality is not the primary value proposition you're selling)
- **Research and education** - Academic research, teaching, personal learning
- **Open source projects** - Building on top of this platform under the same Elastic License 2.0
